Davine, and Middlesex County District Attorney Marian T. Ryan.\\n\\nThe Middlesex District Attorney’s office identified the victim as Hema O. Shahani, 74.\\n\\n“On behalf of the Sudbury Fire Department and our community, I want to express our deepest condolences to Ms. Shahani’s loved ones,” said Chief Whalen. “They lost a cherished family member and all our thoughts are with them right now.”\\n\\nThe three-alarm fire at 30 Goodman’s Hill Road was reported through a 9-1-1 call shortly after 5:00 am on Feb. 21. Ms. Shahani, who had limited mobility, was unable to escape. A family member and a Sudbury Police officer were transported from the scene for injuries sustained while attempting to rescue her.\\n\\nThe origin and cause of the fire were investigated by the Sudbury Fire Department, Sudbury Police Department, State Police Fire & Explosion Investigation Unit assigned to the State Fire Marshal’s office, State Police assigned to the Middlesex DA’s office, and Fire District 14 investigators.\\n\\nThe investigation revealed that the two-story, single-family home had lost heat on the first floor on the night of Feb. 20 into Feb. 21, and that family members used space heaters to provide heat in some areas. At least one of these space heaters ran overnight. Investigators collectively determined that the most likely cause was a circuit overheating while powering the space heater, causing a fire inside the wall. That fire extended to a closet on the opposite side of the wall and continued to spread from there.\\n\\nFire investigators were assisted by members of the Department of Fire Services’ Code Compliance & Enforcement Unit, who found no working smoke alarms in the first- and second-floor living areas.\\n\\n“Our hearts go out to Ms. Shahani’s family and every family that loses a loved one to fire,” said State Fire Marshal Davine. “This was a tragic loss for them and the community. Please, if you do one thing today, check to be sure you have working smoke alarms installed on every level of your home.”\\n\\nSudbury firefighters were assisted at the scene by mutual aid companies from Concord, Framingham, Marlborough, Maynard, Wayland, and Weston. Firefighters from Acton, Lincoln, and Hudson provided station coverage.\\n\\n###'],\n",

       "  'Before I left the city for the prairie, I never thought that I might be a pyromaniac. I’d never started a fire outside a hearth, or thrilled at seeing one burning on the landscape. Then I stood in Nebraska, at dusk, with a crew of wildland firefighters, land managers, and biologists charged with setting fires. Our group had been organized by the local chapter of the conservation organization Pheasants Forever; our job was to burn several thousand acres of prairie in a “prescribed fire,” which would support soil, grasses, and wildlife. Our “burn boss,” a man from California named Dan Kelleher, had a white mustache and luminous blue eyes. He liked to call himself an old hippie, but he was a fire savant. “Play fire scientist,” he told us. How powerfully, timidly, unpredictably, eagerly, or gently did a fire behave and why? What matrix of variables created a fire’s character? We would learn how wind, humidity, topography, fuel, and clouds spurred or inhibited combustion. We’d get to know fire intimately.\\n\\nI was there as a journalist. But I was soon absorbed by the work itself. The mornings began in an old barn. I jumped into a four-wheeled U.T.V., my hands red and aching as I gripped the frozen wheel. We traversed the leks of prairie chickens, whose short-short-long calls reverberated through the early light. At our destination, we’d huddle in the idling truck, waiting for the morning sun to melt the frosted grass and for the night’s high relative humidity to drop. When a favorable reading came in over the radio, we’d rush to assemble our drip torches, put on our fire packs, start our water pumps, and grab hand tools. Kelleher delighted in catching us off guard as we tried to organize ourselves. Without warning, he’d pour fuel on the ground and light a test fire with his “tweaker torch”—a giant lighter he had bought from the local gas station.\\n\\nWe’d stand and watch, observing the flames and the direction of the smoke. The test fires were almost ritualistic. It was as if we were acknowledging the arrival of fire with our attention, or perhaps the fire, in its vibrancy, was capturing us. Once Kelleher gave us the go-ahead, we would start our burn, often incinerating hundreds of acres each day. To manipulate fire precisely amid gusting winds and uneven terrain, we had to think technically about its behavior. We decided from one moment to the next how aggressively or slowly to apply fire on the ground, and in what pattern. In order to predict fire, I had to mentally inhabit it. All of my senses were awakened.\\n\\nThe intense aesthetic pleasure of fire surprised me. The smoke smelled comforting—like a mixture of sage and resin, citronella and my grandpa. There was a kind of horticultural joy, too. Our flames destroyed the young Eastern red cedars that threatened to turn prairie into woodland. The newly blackened earth absorbed the sun and then warmed, which signalled to the bulbs and the rhizomes that they could emerge and drink light from the big sky. Ash and char, I learned, delivered a nutrient pulse that encouraged root growth and maximized carbon storage. Kelleher called fire the “earth’s cleanser,” and he always reminded the crew of its purpose. “Why are we burning?” he would bark, a Marlboro Light between his fingers. “We apply fire to achieve ecological benefits.”\\n\\nAfter one long day, I walked past the reflective windows of a building next to crew headquarters. I didn’t recognize myself. My face and hands were covered in soot. My hair was matted and my leather boots were encrusted with dirt. Fire was changing me, and not just physically. I’d always harbored a sense of unease about my own species; I’d wondered if we were somehow fundamentally ruinous to the earth. Now, with my drip torch in hand, I felt like I was a link in a chain of mutual benefit connecting soil, grass, insects, animals, humans, and sky.\\n\\nBack home in the city, I began looking for other crews to join, so that I could work on more prescribed fires. I woke up in the mornings and e-mailed and called people in New Jersey and Michigan. I bought a plane ticket to Montana to burn five hundred acres in the Blackfoot River watershed, east of Missoula, but the burn got cancelled owing to rain. I seemed to think of nothing but flame. On the phone with a mentor and former wildland firefighter, I tried to put my experience into words. His diagnosis was quick. “You have the fire bug,” he said. “We get bitten by the fire.”\\n\\nThe term “fire bug” is common among wildland firefighters and prescribed-fire practitioners. Some people speak as though they’ve been bit by an actual bug; others seem to imagine a virus that infects. The notion of a sickness or infection seemed to explain better than anything else my unexpected pining for fire. I had the fire bug, but what did that make me? I wondered whether I was becoming some kind of arsonist.\\n\\nKelleher sometimes joked with us before the start of the day’s operations. “What’s that line from ‘Backdraft’?” he’d ask. Then, quoting the pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, from the 1991 movie, he would shout, “Burn it all!” Still, I noticed among my colleagues a general aversion to words like “pyromaniac” or “pyro.” Yes, we exhibited what the DSM-V describes as a “fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire”—one of the signs of pyromania. But when psychiatrists speak about pyromania, they refer to a rare condition defined by a lack of impulse control. In contrast, we took pride in the extreme mental and physical discipline demanded by our jobs; we knew that maintaining control of ourselves was essential in minimizing the dangers of fire.\\n\\nAt the same time, we were practitioners and even disciples of fire. We sometimes called ourselves “students of fire,” a term that implied a posture of humility, and an acknowledgment that fire could never be totally mastered. On fire lines, I saw caution, respect, reverence—and pleasure. Our experiences transcended the binary of “firefighter” or “pyro”—the former heroized, the latter pathologized.\\n\\nMaybe it’s not surprising that we don’t have enough words to describe the complex relationships people can have with fire: for more than a century, our society has sought to remove it from the land even as our daily lives have become dependent on a different kind of combustion. Throughout American history, as the historian Stephen Pyne writes in his book “Between Two Fires,” landscape fires were seen as “beneath the dignity of an aspiring great power and Enlightened society.” During the twentieth century, state and national campaigns to stop fire starters in prairies and forests were often aggressive; in the South, long-held fire traditions supporting hunting, harvesting, gathering, and grazing were described by a government psychologist as ignorant traditions; one academic called them “ancestor worship.” Meanwhile, in the West, Native Americans risked fines and imprisonment for managing lands with fire, and wildfire lookout towers were erected on sacred mountain peaks. These campaigns coincided with often sensational coverage of arsonists in newspapers and tabloids. When the term “fire bug” appeared, as early as the mid-nineteenth century, it was used to describe people who’d been accused of setting fires in protest, for revenge, for insurance payouts, for political reasons, or simply because the moon was full.\\n\\nSome foresters saw the foolishness of trying to prevent fire-adapted landscapes from burning. They pointed out that the accumulation of fuels over time would eventually lead to bigger blazes. They were castigated for advocating “Paiute forestry,” and branded as “light burners.” In 1935, the chief of the U.S. Forest Service implemented “an experiment on a continental scale,” and decreed that any wildland fire that broke out had to be extinguished by 10 A.M. the following morning. The logic of suppressing fires was deemed unassailable, and the act of lighting them rendered subversive. Today, it’s easy to wonder how things would have turned out if the light-burners had won the debate. What if fire-lighting had been recognized as a benign and necessary form of stewardship? How many current environmental crises might have been averted if the relationship between people, landscape, and fire had not been so misunderstood?\\n\\nSome wildland firefighters describe the fire bug as something that’s always existed inside them, like a kink in their DNA. I ask them: When did you light your first fire? They were often surprisingly young. The late ecologist and fire advocate Herbert Stoddard set his first fire when he was five years old. During the late eighteen-hundreds, in Florida, where he grew up, it was normal for women and children to set fires around their homes, burning away underbrush to prevent future conflagrations and maintain the open longleaf pine forests.\\n\\nIn a book called “Pathological Firesetting,” from 1951, the authors described fire-setters as people who indulge in “the magical power of the child to create and destroy whole worlds.” I think of that line when I watch my six-year-old sit inside his outdoor fort, feeding twigs to the fires he starts in a little stone hearth. His state of trance-like reverie reminds me that our species’ connection to fire is very, very old. Maybe we all have the kink. I’ve set fires in oak woodlands, longleaf pine savannahs, marshes, pocosin, bottomland hardwood swamps, and ponderosa pine forests. Sleeping on the ground or in the back of rental cars, far from my kids, tired and dirty, I’ve sometimes thought I might have gone mad.\\n\\nBut I keep seeking out fire because of what I learn. In thousands of small instances, fire has shown me how death is a necessary ecological condition of life. I have seen that people are not fundamentally ruinous—just currently remiss in their responsibilities to the land. My competence in the work itself, utilizing machines, tools, and my own hands, never fails to quiet some thrumming tension in my core, a need to be an instrument for fulfilling responsibilities. I’ve set fires alongside little kids and people in their seventies. I’m determined to be a student of fire into old age myself. Meanwhile, the fire bug continues to afflict me. Some months ago, I found out I was going to have another child. The first thing I did was count on my fingers. With relief, I calculated that I would have just enough time after giving birth to get into shape and return to the prairie to burn in the spring. ♦'],\n",

       "  \"MADISON, Wis. – As temperatures rise and more people get outside early this week, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) asks the public to stay vigilant and avoid burning because of high fire danger statewide.\\n\\nLack of snow cover and accumulated rain statewide are causing an early start to Wisconsin's wildfire season. Over the past weekend alone, the DNR responded to 15 wildfires burning nearly 30 acres.\\n\\nThe forecast for the early part of this week indicates warm temperatures, low humidity and breezy conditions. On windy, dry days, embers from any fire, especially burn piles and campfires, can easily escape control and cause a wildfire if not properly extinguished.\\n\\nTo help keep Wisconsinites safe, the DNR asks you to avoid all outdoor burning, including limiting the use of campfires and bonfires. Be sure to discard hot ashes from woodstoves or fireplaces in a metal container until cold. Outdoor enthusiasts should also use caution with off-road vehicles or equipment that can create a spark and start a fire.\\n\\nThe DNR is suspending annual burn permits in 25 counties where the DNR has protection responsibility. Check with local authorities if your property is outside the DNR's jurisdiction.\\n\\nSo far in 2024, the DNR has already responded to over 50 fires burning 160 acres; the 10-year average is three wildfires burning two acres. The majority of these recent wildfires have been related to debris burning.\\n\\nCheck before you burn. Remember – fire danger and burning restrictions change every day.\\n\\nFIRE SAFETY TIPS\\n\\nAvoid outdoor burning until conditions improve. Burn permits for debris burning are currently suspended in numerous counties.\\n\\nOperate equipment (chainsaws, off-road vehicles, lawnmowers, etc.) early in the morning or late in the day to avoid sparks at peak burn hours.\\n\\nSecure dragging trailer chains.\\n\\nReport fires early by calling 911.\\n\\nCheck current fire danger, wildfire reports and burning restrictions on the DNR website.\\n\\nFor a more comprehensive view of current fire activity, visit the DNR's wildfire dashboard.\"],\n",

Even so, library preservationists and fire remediators are working to return all collections to service as soon as possible.\\n\\nAs soon as the fire was extinguished and they were cleared to enter the building, Conservator Hillary Morgan and Head of Preservation & Collection Care Section Megan Lambert got to work assessing the damage to the collection and planning the recovery.\\n\\n“Fortunately there was minimal damage to the collection since the fire was put out quickly,” said Lambert. “Materials closest to the source of the fire had ash and soot which included reference, popular reading, periodicals and some display collections. From our initial assessment, very few, if any, materials will need to be replaced.”\\n\\nThe University Libraries are working with SERVPRO, a restoration service company, to clean up and mitigate most of the damage including removing soot off the surface of books using HEPA filtered vacuums and vulcanized rubber sponges that pick up particulates.\\n\\n“Soot and smoke can be abrasive,” explained Morgan. “While mechanically cleaning materials, especially more fragile materials, we have to go slowly otherwise we can cause more damage and staining.”\\n\\nSERVPRO is working around the clock to clean library spaces and collections. Once they have finished, Preservation will review the insides of the books in the area and conduct spot checks to make sure there isn’t any extra cleaning that needs to be done.\\n\\n“We are hoping that air and surface cleaning will prevent any residual smoke smell on the books,” said Lambert. “Many of the materials in the vicinity have glossy coated paper and use library binding covers which are the most durable covers you can have in a library. They are easier to clean and less likely to have particulates ingrained in compared to cloth or leather.”\\n\\nAfter the fire, the library was aired out to help dissipate the smoke smell and SERVPRO is using negative air machines which pull the air through filters to decrease all the particulates.\\n\\nAdditionally, a few paintings were affected with soot damage on the surface and behind the canvas. Because soot is acidic, the Libraries are working with Colorado Art Restoration Services (CARS) to test the paintings for damage and assess the need for cleaning.\\n\\nA CU Boulder alum and former Libraries preservation student worker, Mak Morton, now works for CARS and is helping with the restoration.

       " ['OSHA Proposes to Replace Its Existing Fire Brigades Standard With New Comprehensive Emergency Response Standard',\n",
       "  None,\n",
       "  'Quick Hits\\n\\nOSHA has proposed a rule that would transform the Fire Brigades standard into an Emergency Response standard.\\n\\nThe proposed rule would cover not only firefighting, but also emergency medical services, tactical rescue, and the equivalent services offered in workplaces by employer-provided services.\\n\\nComments are due no later than May 6, 2024.\\n\\nWith the potential exception of the COVID-19 standards OSHA created, no other proposal for a change in OSHA standards in recent memory has been as comprehensive as these changes. Comments on the proposal are due on or before May 6, 2024.\\n\\nThe 250-page NPRM transforms 29 C.F.R. § 1910.156 into an entirely new standard, but it also makes important changes to:\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.6 Incorporation by reference\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.120 Hazardous waste operations and emergency response and Appendix B\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.134 Respiratory protection\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.155 Scope, application and definitions applicable to this subpart\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.157 Portable fire extinguishers\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.158 Standpipe and hose systems\\n\\n29 C.F.R. § 1910.159 Automatic sprinkler systems\\n\\nMost of the changes to these standards are modest. The last two, 29 C.F.R. §§ 1910.158 and 1910.159, essentially do nothing more than require that those systems are compatible with what local fire departments use to couple with them.\\n\\nOverview of Requirements\\n\\nThere is no way this article can cover in detail all of the nuances of the proposed standard, given its length and complexity, but those requirements include:\\n\\nOrganization of the Workplace Emergency Response Team, Workplace Emergency Response Employer, or Emergency Service Organization; Establishing the organization’s emergency response plan; Establishing the organization’s emergency service(s) capability(ies); Team member and responder participation; Creation of a risk management plan; Responder medical and physical requirements; Minimum training requirement; Facility preparedness activities; Equipment and personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements; Vehicle preparedness and operational requirements; Pre-incident planning requirements; Incident Management System (IMS) creation; Creation of emergency incident protocols; Post-incident analysis; and Program analysis.\\n\\nNational Fire Protection Association Standards\\n\\nThe proposed Emergency Response standard incorporates by reference twenty-two National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards, most of which are focused on firefighting training, personal protective equipment, health and safety requirements, and apparatus. Though the standard relates to other types of emergency response, much of it does so with a strong firefighting influence.\\n\\nESOs and WEREs\\n\\nThe new version of 29 C.F.R. § 1910.156 is divided into nineteen sections and categorizes subject employers as either Emergency Service Organizations (ESOs) or Workplace Emergency Response Employers (WEREs), sometimes referred to as Workplace Emergency Response Teams (WERTs). WEREs and WERTs are often found in chemical plants, refineries, large manufacturing facilities, and power generation facilities where the size of the workforce and the hazards associated with an emergency are such that the owners and operators of those facilities find value in having on-site fire departments and/or emergency medical responders. While there is a differentiation between these types of entities, many of the requirements applicable to ESOs are identical to those for WEREs/WERTs.\\n\\nVehicle Preparedness and Operation\\n\\nThere are some serious questions about OSHA’s authority with regard to portions of the proposed standard, such as those related to vehicle preparedness and operational requirements. On-road vehicle design has never been subject to OSHA oversight and traditionally has fallen under the U.S. Department of Transportation’s and/or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s purview. Regardless, this standard would require compliance with standards created by OSHA, as well as those established by the NFPA. Similarly, on-road vehicle operation has never been subject to OSHA regulation, but this standard would do so as it relates to emergency response vehicles. Depending on how OSHA applies the standard, it even goes as far as to the personal vehicles operated by volunteer fire fighters or emergency medical responders who use their own vehicles to respond to emergencies.\\n\\nVolunteer Services\\n\\nOSHA clearly intends that volunteer fire departments and volunteer emergency medical services be covered by this standard, and the NPRM discusses employment law cases that relate to control and remuneration for services provided. While many of these volunteer services are public or quasi-public entities, in certain parts of the country they are private organizations, and, as a result, these private organizations would likely be subject to coverage under this standard. As state plans would be required to adopt the standard or the equivalent, this would require public and quasi-public entities in those states to comply with the standard.\\n\\nEmergency Responders’ Physical and Mental Health\\n\\nNearly 80 percent of paramedics self-reported being overweight or obese, according to a 2015 study cited by OSHA in the proposed rule, and for many years there have been shortages of emergency medical service employees, yet the proposed standard calls for the creation of minimum medical requirements commensurate with the requirements of the position, ongoing medical evaluations, and fitness programs. There are no exceptions for provider disability or age contained within the standard. Moreover, mental health services would have to be provided (though they can be provided through community-based resources) to providers engaged in “potentially traumatic events.”\\n\\nKey Takeaways\\n\\nIf the proposed rule is adopted, the impact on subject employers will be massive and compliance difficult. Most of the providers of the sort of services covered by the proposed standard are private employers that augment services provided by public or quasi-public providers. While the proposed standard, if adopted, would require the creation of mutual aid agreements for a number of reasons, the efforts to negotiate those agreements will be influenced considerably by the fact that the public and quasi-public entities are not compelled to do so. Private entities providing services in the same communities may allow competition to serve as barriers to creating such agreements.\\n\\nOgletree Deakins’ Workplace Safety and Health Practice Group will continue to monitor developments and will publish updates on the Workplace Safety and Health blog as additional information becomes available. Further information on OSHA’s Emergency Response proposed rule is available via the firm’s recent podcast program.\\n\\nTo learn more about OSHA’s proposed rule to replace its existing Fire Brigades standard, please join us at Ogletree Deakins’ national Workplace Strategies program, which will feature a breakout session entitled “To Inspections and Beyond: The Latest From OSHA (and Cal/OSHA).” This annual seminar, which will be held May 1–4, 2024, at the historic Washington Hilton in Washington, D.C., is the premier event of its kind for sophisticated HR professionals, in-house counsel, and other business professionals.\\n\\nFollow and Subscribe\\n\\nLinkedIn | Instagram | Webinars | Podcasts']]"
