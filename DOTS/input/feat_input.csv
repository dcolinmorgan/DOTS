Syria,16-01-2024,"['Millions of Syrians face hunger with the suspension of all in-kind WFP food aid this month, in part due to major cuts to US funding. US aid cuts of up to 50 percent are expected across all humanitarian sectors in 2024, senior humanitarian sources said.', '16 January 2024', 'MARSEILLE — Millions of Syrians lost a lifeline this month, after the World Food Program (WFP) suspended all in-kind food assistance across Syria due to an unprecedented budget shortfall, owing in large part to drastic cuts in United States government funding, senior humanitarian sources told Syria Direct.', 'The United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), through its Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), not only supports United Nations (UN) programs like the WFP, but also directly funds non-governmental organizations in Syria.\xa0', 'BHA funding cuts of up to 50 percent for many programs are expected this year across all humanitarian sectors, two senior humanitarian sources based in northeastern Syria told Syria Direct.\xa0', '“Gaza of course has an impact on Syria,” one humanitarian source said, referring to the humanitarian crisis resulting from Israel’s ongoing war in the Palestinian territory. The other noted that cuts are expected “across all the [humanitarian] sectors,” including “camp-based activities,” with the exception of Al-Hol camp holding families of former Islamic State fighters.', 'The WFP is funded primarily by governments, alongside private donations. The US, the single largest donor to the WFP, has so far contributed around $207 million in 2024 as of January 15. In 2023, it gave a total of $3 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2022. Germany, the second-largest donor, has contributed $127 million so far this year, in addition to $1.3 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022.', 'According to the WFP’s 2024-2026 management plan released in late 2023, the UN food body expected to receive $10 billion in 2024, while it projected it needed $22.7 billion for operational requirements.', 'In Syria, even before the latest WFP cuts, “the level of aid did not correspond to the level of need,” Saleem Algerk, media coordinator at Shafak organization, one of WFP’s implementing partners, told Syria Direct. “Thus, if aid decreases, the difficult humanitarian situation and the number of people under the poverty line will increase,” he added. Ninety percent of Syrians already live below the poverty line.', 'Direct US funding for NGOs working in Syria poses another stark challenge. In the opposition-held northwest—home to more than four million people, more than half of whom are internally displaced—the US is the largest single donor for service delivery, Nicole Hark, Mercy Corps Country Director for Syria, told Syria Direct.\xa0', 'For Layla, a 41-year-old mother of six living in a displacement camp in Syria’s opposition-held northwest, losing WFP food aid this month was only the latest blow.\xa0', 'Initially displaced from their native Hama to Idlib province, her family’s home in the town of Jenderes was destroyed last year in the devastating February 6 earthquake that struck Syria and Turkey. They found themselves displaced once more—this time to a camp.', '“Getting by has become very hard,” Layla told Syria Direct. Her husband, who has Hepatitis B, has not been able to work for four years. Each time aid is cut, the family falls further into debt, borrowing money to survive.\xa0', 'In July 2023, around 45 percent of the\xa0 5.5 million Syrians receiving WFP food assistance lost it. Layla’s family still received aid, but distributions were reduced from once a month to once every two months. This month, however, they were completely cut off—among the 3.2 million Syrians still receiving aid after the July cut who have now lost support.\xa0', 'This follows repeated WFP aid cuts in recent months to Syrians both inside Syria and in neighboring countries—as well as other countries across the world. In 2024, the UN food body faces an unprecedented 60 percent funding shortfall due to increasing needs and decreasing contributions. For 2023, less than half of the $23.5 billion needed to fund its global operations was secured.\xa0', '“I wish the aid would come back for the displaced people who left their homes and are staying in camps,” Layla. “We hope it comes back so that we can live.” Her family not only relied on food aid for sustenance, but sold portions to buy bread, medicine and other foods not included in it.\xa0', 'The WFP estimates that 12.9 million Syrians—more than half of the country’s total population—will go hungry this year, with another 2.6 million people at risk of becoming food insecure.\xa0', 'One humanitarian source involved in cross-border WFP aid delivery, who asked to remain anonymous, speculated that food assistance could resume, albeit with a reduced scope. The source suggested aid could be delivered directly by the UN body, rather than implementing partners—organizations on the ground funded to distribute assistance on its behalf—as has previously been the case.\xa0', 'Some direct WFP cross-line shipments to northern Syria, originating from regime-controlled areas rather than delivered across the border from Turkey, have taken place in the past, but with little visibility, the source added. If the WFP were to directly deliver aid, it could mean that all food assistance would be distributed cross-line.', 'For Syria’s opposition-held northwest, where an estimated 75 percent of the population relies on UN assistance, the way that aid arrives is crucial. Cross-border aid deliveries, rather than cross-line aid originating in regime-held territory, are a way to ensure that vital supplies are not withheld or diverted by Damascus. But the future of cross-border access, by the WFP or other UN agencies, is far from certain.\xa0', 'Starting in July 2014, a cross-border mechanism established by a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution authorized UN aid shipments into Syria from Turkey without the need for regime authorization. But in July 2023, Russia vetoed the most recent vote to extend the mechanism, leaving authorization for cross-border deliveries under Damascus’ discretion. Following the Russian veto, the Syrian regime granted cross-border access for six months until January 13, 2024.', 'On January 12, one day before it was set to expire, the UN reached an agreement with Damascus to extend cross-border access for UN aid shipments from Turkey by six months until July 13, 2024.\xa0', 'However, under the latest agreement, only one border crossing—Bab al-Hawa—will remain open for the full six months. The Bab al-Rai and Bab al-Salama crossings, which were opened with the regime’s authorization following last year’s earthquake, will only be open until February 13, 2024. Their closure will impact the “ease and speed” of aid deliveries, Algerk said, in what he called an “increasingly difficult humanitarian situation.”\xa0', 'For nearly a decade, UN cross-border access renewals have progressively been shortened: from two years to one year, and finally to six months. Uncertainty about sustained access leads donors to issue short grants that do not allow for “sustainability or long-term planning,” Algerk explained.', 'In the absence of cross-border access, UN aid shipments would come exclusively via areas controlled by Damascus, which has “a long history in politicizing, manipulating, and weaponizing aid,” Mohamad Katoub, a humanitarian expert, explained.\xa0', 'Algerk feared “the regime would starve everyone.” In a 2019 report, Human Rights Watch exposed the systematic diversion of aid in favor of regime-affiliated figures and armed groups, as well as the blocking of aid to opposition-controlled areas.', 'In-kind food assistance is not the only support threatened by dwindling funding and aid cuts. In northwestern Syria, cuts disproportionately affect displacement camps where 1.7 million people reside, Hark of Mercy Corps said. Her organization is among those that have been forced to cease services in camps there.\xa0', 'The implications for water and sanitation are particularly dire, Hark said. With the end of support for services displaced people rely on such as water pumping stations, “families have no other recourse but to use their limited income to buy water from private sources that lack quality control,” with risks for renewed cholera outbreaks. “Northwestern Syria is facing spikes and ebbs in cholera cases and this will likely exacerbate conditions towards an increase,” she added.\xa0', 'Since September 2022, when the first cholera outbreak since the Syrian conflict was recorded, northwestern Syria has faced several cholera surges—especially in the aftermath of the February earthquake, culminating in more than 13,000 cases last April.', 'Read more: Northern Syria’s cholera outbreak spreads, reaches Idlib displacement camps', 'Amid US aid cuts, one European diplomatic source said he expected regional actors, such as Turkey, to step in to fill the gap. This could mean funding projects by institutional actors like the UN or USAID. For example, Saudi Arabia has provided $100 million in funding to US stabilization projects in northeastern Syria.', 'It could also mean bypassing international institutions altogether. In the case of the latter, certain areas could be deprived of aid for political reasons. For example, northeastern Syria, which is controlled by Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists, would likely be deprived of aid coming directly from Ankara.', 'The persistent threat posed by aid cuts is a symptom of a larger, structural problem: For nearly 13 years, the international response to the Syrian crisis has been frozen in an emergency phase, without sustainable solutions.', '“The crisis has been ongoing for more than a decade and [yet] we’re still talking about emergency assistance,” one of the humanitarian sources in northeastern Syria said.\xa0', '“Donors and UN agencies knew this moment would come one day and did nothing over the years,” Katoub said. He said that Syria programming is still in an emergency phase, rather than early recovery, because the humanitarian aid system is “very bureaucratic and very politicized.”', 'Early recovery is the transition from humanitarian aid towards development that allows for a “sustainable process of recovery from crisis,” according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This includes the rehabilitation of “markets, livelihoods and services and the state capacities to foster them.”\xa0', 'According to the senior humanitarian worker in northeastern Syria, resilience programming is “a key exit strategy for regular food assistance” to achieve “sustainability.” This could include “livelihood transitions, capacity development projects, better quality cash programming, and more focus on climate change adaptation,” notably “making agriculture sustainable” in a country that was self-sufficient in food production before the war.\xa0', 'However, according to Katoub, early recovery programming today accounts for less than 9 percent of what is needed. In its absence, he warned vulnerable communities will remain “dependent on aid,” making the consequences of any aid cuts “horrific.”', 'Syria Direct is an independent journalism organization that produces timely, credible coverage of Syria while training a small group of highly talented, aspiring Syrian and international journalists in professional news-gathering and accurate, in-depth reporting.

['volvo'],16-01-2024,"['On the night of Thursday 11-Friday 12 January the US and UK militaries bombed sites in Yemen controlled by the Houthi movement. The stated aim of the action, according to a UK spokesperson, was to, “protect vessels and freedom of navigation [in the Red Sea],” by destroying Houthi military bases, radar installations, drone and missile launch sites.', 'The US claimed to have hit 28 targets with 150 missiles. The Houthis say there were 72 strikes and five of their fighters were killed. They promised to take revenge on the US.', 'The relatively small death toll, if accurate, probably indicates that the sites the US hit had been largely evacuated. The US issued a warning to the Houthis, in advance, and probably has not so far done much damage to Houthi military infrastructure.', 'Since October the Houthis have launched missile and drone strikes on the Israeli port of Eliat and international shipping in the Red Sea in support of Hamas in Gaza.', 'On 19 November Houthi troops landed by helicopter on Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated cargo ship linked to an Israeli billionaire. The hijacked ship was taken to Salif, a port in Western Yemen. ', 'The Houthis have conducted 27 attacks on civilian ships since mid-October and on the evening of Tuesday 9 January they launched 18 drones and three missiles at UK and US warships which had been sent to the Red Sea to defend the shipping lanes.', 'Cargo has been re-routed, and complex supply chains have been disrupted, including, for example, Tesla and Volvo car production in Europe which depends on components shipped from Asia.', 'The Houthis are Shiite Muslims based in the north of Yemen who currently control most of the inhabited areas of the country, including the capital, Sana’a, which they overran in 2014. The ultra-reactionary movement’s main slogan is, “God is the greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews.”', 'The Houthis are aligned with Iran, which supplies them with weaponry and training, although they are from different branches of Shiia Islam and are not natural close allies. The Houthis retain their own independent command structures, have a distinct set of priorities, and are not Iranian state puppets.', ""The Houthis' campaign to support Hamas by targeting ships in the Red Sea is to be condemned. Disrupting the world economy in this way, for these reasons, is not a progressive act “against imperialism” or a “defence of the Palestinians.” These are actions of a religious-military dictatorship motivated by ideological sympathy for the Hamas pogrom against Israeli Jews."", 'But it is not clear that the US-UK military action will help – that it will stop the Houthis, who seem to be looking for a confrontation. The Houthi movement has just emerged from a long-running war with a Saudi-UAE-led coalition. They have built a sophisticated, large and adaptable military machine.', 'The Saudis aimed to smash the Iran-backed movement and launched 25,000 airstrikes on Yemen over seven years after 2015. The Houthis saw off the Saudis and UAE troops, and emerged stronger and much better armed. The Saudi action pushed the Houthis closer to Iran.', 'The US-UK action has strengthened the Houthis’ position inside Yemen. There was an enormous demonstration against the Western bombing in Sana’a on Friday 12 January.', 'The Western powers have also made a regional war more likely.', 'What the US and its allies should do, positively, is openly demand that the Israeli government stops the war in Gaza and offers the Palestinians a free, independent state alongside Israel.

View the prescribed fire map with project details and locations at Tahoe Living With Fire. To be added to the prescribed fire notification list, send us an email, sm.fs.paltbmu@usda.gov.', 'Prescribed fires are a vital forest management tool used by land managers to help protect communities by removing fuels that can feed unwanted wildland fires. Burning excess vegetation also benefits forest health by making room for new growth which provides forage for wildlife, recycling nutrients back into the soil and reducing the spread of insects and disease.', 'Prescribed fire managers use different methods to remove excess vegetation (fuels) and reintroduce low-intensity fire into forests through pile, broadcast, and understory burning. Pile burning involves burning slash piles that are constructed by hand or mechanical equipment. Broadcast and understory burning use low-intensity fire to remove fuels under specific environmental conditions with fire confined to a predetermined area.', 'Historically, low-intensity wildfires ignited by lightning or native peoples routinely burned through fire-adapted ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada.', 'These low-intensity fires burned at low temperatures and moved slowly across the ground removing forest debris such as pinecones, needles, limbs, dead and downed trees, and ladder fuels. Watch the Forest Service video for an in-depth explanation of low-intensity fire. Prescribed fires are intended to mimic these naturally occurring low-intensity fires that are essential to fire-adapted ecosystems.', 'Prescribed fires may take place any time of year when conditions are favorable. Winter typically brings cooler temperatures and precipitation, which are ideal for conducting prescribed fire operations. Each operation follows a specialized burn plan, which considers smoke dispersal conditions, temperature, humidity, wind, and vegetation moisture. All this information is used to decide when and where to burn.', 'The TFFT strongly supports the use of prescribed fire under appropriate conditions and works closely with air quality districts to avert smoke impacts on the public. Smoke from prescribed fires is normal and may continue for several days after an ignition depending on the project size, conditions, and weather.', 'Prescribed fire smoke is generally less intense and of much shorter duration than smoke produced by unwanted wildfires. Smoke from prescribed burns, wildfire or wood burning stoves may hang low to the ground at night and in the early morning due to a phenomenon known as a temperature inversion. A temperature inversion is when warm air “caps” cooler air, causing smoke to become trapped in valley bottoms at night and in the early morning.', 'Prior to prescribed fire ignitions, agencies coordinate closely with local and state air quality agencies to monitor weather for favorable conditions that will disperse smoke, conduct test burns before igniting larger areas to verify how well vegetation is consumed and how smoke rises and disperses before proceeding, post signs on roadways in areas affected by prescribed fire operations, email notifications to the prescribed fire notification list, and update the local fire information line at 530-543-2816.

Molten lava destroyed multiple homes in the town of Grindavík, which had been evacuated hours before. There is no danger to the rest of the island, home to roughly 380,000 people and 33 active volcano systems.', '[Related: How the Tonga eruption rang Earth ‘like a bell’]', 'Iceland sits over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. The country averages about one volcanic eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive eruption in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. Enormous clouds of ash spewed into the atmosphere, disrupting air travel across the Atlantic Ocean for months. This eruption is not expected to push large quantities of ash into the air and operations at Keflavík Airport are continuing as normal.', 'According to Iceland’s Meteorological Office (IMO), it is still too soon to officially declare the danger from this most recent eruption over and difficult to estimate how long it will last. The IMO said that their GPS sensors continued to detect that the magma conduit beneath Grindavík is expanding in the area. Thermal drone images taken show that the fissures previously mapped southwest of Grindavík have enlarged and considerable hazards still remain in the area.', 'Following the eruption, a series of earthquakes began at 3:00 a.m. local time near Sundhnúksgígar. The earthquakes then migrated southwest towards Grindavík. This seismic swarm opened a lava-spewing fissure by 8 a.m. The fissure spread to within 3,000 feet of the fishing town, which is about 30 miles southwest of the capital city Reykjavik. By noon, another fissure had opened north of Grindavík.', 'Icelandic University volcanologist Þorvaldur Þórðarson, told the Iceland Monitor that eruptive activity shifted from the upper fissure and is creeping closer to Grindavík. If this continues, there are two possible scenarios.', '“One is that if the shift is made, then the activity will continue in the lower fissure,” he said. In this situation, the lava will continue to head towards the town.\xa0', '“The other scenario, which is even worse, is that this is an addition to what is happening in the upper fissure,” he said. “This increases the eruption.”', 'An operation to rescue about 270 sheep stranded in more dangerous locations has also begun.

against the tiny coastal enclave.\n', '\n The fighting in the north, which was the first target of Israel’s offensive and where entire neighbourhoods have been pulverised, showed how far Israel remains from achieving its goals of dismantling Hamas and returning scores of hostages captured in the October 7 attack which sparked the war.\n', '\n Meanwhile, Gaza’s humanitarian crisis is worsening, with 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians fleeing their homes and UN agencies warning of mass starvation and disease.\n', '\n The conflict threatens to widen after the US and Israel traded strikes with Iranian-backed groups across the region.\n', '\n Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’s military and governing capabilities to ensure the October 7 attack is never repeated.\n', '\n Militants stormed into Israel from Gaza that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing around 250 people.\n', '\n With strong diplomatic and military support from the US, Israel has resisted international calls for a ceasefire.\n', '\n Nearly half of the hostages were released during a weeklong truce in November but more than 100 remain in captivity.\n', '\n Hamas said it will not release any more until Israel ends the war.\n', '\n The longer the war goes on, the more it threatens to ignite other fronts across the region.\n', '\n Iran fired missiles late on Monday at what it said were Israeli “spy headquarters” in an upscale neighbourhood near the sprawling US consulate in Irbil, the seat of Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region.\n', '\n Iraq and the US condemned the strikes, which killed several civilians, and Baghdad recalled its ambassador to Iran in protest.\n', '\n Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have carried out dozens of attacks on bases housing US forces, and a US airstrike in Baghdad killed an Iranian-backed militia leader earlier this month.\n', '\n Elsewhere, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed their attacks on container ships in the Red Sea following a wave of US-led strikes last week.\n', '\n The US carried out another strike on Tuesday, a US official said.\n', '\n The US military said earlier in the day that two Navy Seals are missing after a raid last week on a ship carrying Iranian-made missile parts and weapons bound for Yemen.\n', '\n Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have exchanged fire along the border nearly every day since the war in Gaza began.\n', '\n The strikes and counterstrikes have grown more severe since an Israeli strike killed Hamas’s deputy political leader in Beirut this month, raising fears of a repeat of the 2006 war.\n', '\n In Gaza, the Israeli military said its forces located some 100 rocket installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets in the area of Beit Lahiya, a town on the territory’s northern edge.\n', '\n Israeli forces killed dozens of militants during the operation, the military said without providing evidence.\n', '\n Mahmoud Abdel-Ghani, who lives in Beit Lahiya, said Israeli airstrikes hit several buildings on the eastern side of the town.\n', '\n Hundreds of thousands of people fled northern Gaza, including Gaza City, following Israeli evacuation orders in October.\n', '\n Israel shut off water to the region in the opening days of the war and hardly any aid has been allowed into the north, even as tens of thousands of people have remained there.\n', '\n Residents reached by phone on Tuesday described the heaviest fighting in weeks in Gaza City.\n', '\n “The bombing never stopped,” said Faris Abu Abbas, who lives

they were scaling back operations there.\n', '\n The focus shifted to the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.\n', '\n But there too, they have encountered heavy resistance.\n', '\n The military said at least 25 rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday, damaging a shop in one of the strongest bombardments in more than a week.\n', '\n Israel’s Channel 12 television said the rockets were launched from the Bureij camp in central Gaza.\n', '\n Gaza’s Health Ministry said on Tuesday that the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been taken to hospitals in the past 24 hours, bringing the war’s overall death toll to 24,285.\n', '\n The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.\n', '\n Senior UN officials said on Monday that Gaza faces widespread famine and disease if more aid is not allowed in.\n', '\n While they did not directly blame Israel, they said aid delivery is hobbled by the opening of too few border crossings, a slow vetting process and continuing fighting throughout the territory — all of which is largely under Israel’s control.\n', '\n UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said UN agencies and their partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment”.\n', '\n At least 152 UN workers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.\n', '\n Israeli officials say they have placed no limits on humanitarian aid and have called on the UN to provide more workers and trucks to accelerate delivery.\n', '\n Israel completely sealed off Gaza after Hamas’s October 7 attack and only relented under US pressure.\n', '\n The US, as well as the UN, have continued to push Israel to ease the flow of aid.\n', '\n Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas.\n', '\n Israel says its forces have killed roughly 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 190 of its own soldiers have died in the Gaza offensive.\n',

You may opt out at any time.', 'Iran on Monday fired several ballistic missiles at what it called “anti-Iranian terrorist groups,” including alleged Israeli “spy headquarters,” in Erbil, the capital of Iraq’s semiautonomous Kurdistan region.', 'According to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the targets were places used to plan the bombings in Kerman, Iran, on Jan. 3 that killed around 95 people attending a ceremony commemorating late military commander Qassem Suleimani. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for that bombing. Iranian forces also targeted a base allegedly linked to the Islamic State in Idlib, Syria, IRGC commander Amir Ali Hajizadeh said on Tuesday. As for the strike on what it claimed was a headquarters used by Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency, the IRGC said it was conducted in response to Israeli “atrocities” targeting Iranian commanders and those of Iranian-allied groups in the region.', '“We assure our nation that the Guards’ offensive operations will continue until avenging the last drops of martyrs’ blood,” the IRGC said in a statement.', 'At least four civilians were killed in the Erbil strike, including multimillionaire businessman Peshraw Dizayi and members of his family, and six others were injured. Iraqi Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani condemned the assault on the sidelines of this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Iraqi officials said Iran’s claims were groundless, and Barzani added that the strikes were a “crime against the Kurdish people.” Iraq has since recalled its ambassador from Tehran and summoned Iran’s charge d’affaires to Baghdad to express anger over the attack.', '“The Revolutionary Guard said that the attack targeted several sites of Iranian opposition groups. Unfortunately, they always use baseless excuses to attack Erbil,” the Kurdish region’s security council said.', 'The strike, near the U.S. consulate in Kurdistan’s capital, also drew sharp condemnation from Washington and its Western allies. The U.S. State Department condemned “Iran’s reckless missile strikes,” with National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson pledging U.S. support for “the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of Iraq.” France called Iran’s assault a “blatant, unacceptable, and concerning violation” of Iraqi security.', 'Adding to escalating regional tensions, Iranian state media announced that Iranian forces had launched missile and drone strikes against what it said were bases used by the militant group Jaish al-Adl in Pakistan on Tuesday. Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry strongly condemned the attack, saying two children were killed and three others wounded. It has since called Iran’s charge d’affaires to Islamabad.', 'Jaish al-Adl had previously launched attacks on Iranian forces along the two countries’ shared border. Tehran and Islamabad maintain strained diplomatic ties, making some experts fear that this assault could kick-start a conflict between Iran and a nuclear-armed Pakistan. “It is even more concerning that this illegal act has taken place despite the existence of several channels of communication between Pakistan and Iran,” Pakistan’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said.', 'Muted response. The Chinese Communist Party on Monday published for the first time sections of a 2022 speech given by Chinese President Xi Jinping at an internal event, in which he called to “develop and strengthen the patriotic, pro-unification forces in Taiwan, oppose the separatist acts of ‘Taiwan independence,’ and promote the complete reunification of the motherland.” Other parts of Xi’s 2022 speech had previously been made public.', 'The newly published remarks came just two days after Taiwanese voters elected pro-independence candidate Lai Ching-te of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan’s Saturday presidential election. China summoned the Philippines’ ambassador on Tuesday after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. congratulated Lai, accusing Manila of violating the “One China” policy and warning the Philippine leader “not to play with fire.”', 'Meanwhile, Xi celebrated Nauru’s decision on Monday to cut diplomatic ties with Taipei and officially realign with Beijing. The Pacific island’s switch means that only 12 nations now recognize Taiwan, mostly in Latin America and the Pacific Ocean.', 'Yemen’s aid crisis. A coalition of 23 aid agencies warned on Tuesday that escalating military operations in Yemen are compromising their ability to deliver critical services. More than 21 million people, or over two-thirds of the nation’s population, are in desperate need of food, water, and medical care in one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.', 'Houthi attacks against commercial shipping vessels in the Red Sea and the international community’s response have worsened the ongoing crisis. The U.S. and U.K. militaries launched a wave of airstrikes against the Houthis last Thursday in retaliation for a spate of shipping attacks; on Monday, the rebel group targeted Gibraltar Eagle, a U.S.-owned ship in the Red Sea—marking around 30 attacks on international shipping since mid-November 2023.', 'Gender-based violence. Transgender activist and politician Samantha Gómez Fonseca was killed in Mexico City on Sunday prior to a march demanding greater acceptance of LGBTQ people, specifically transgender individuals. Around 100 people took to the capital’s main thoroughfare on Monday to protest rising violence against the LGBTQ community. At least three transgender people have been killed in the country since Jan. 1, with another two cases currently being investigated.', 'Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has a history of making incendiary remarks about transgender people. This month, he referred to a parliamentarian as a “man dressed as a woman,” later issuing an apology for misgendering his colleague. More than 320 transgender and gender-diverse people worldwide were murdered between October 2022 and September 2023, according to the Trans Murder Monitoring project.', 'A Quebec man pleaded guilty on Monday to starting 14 forest fires that forced hundreds of Canadians to evacuate their homes. Brian Paré, 38, had falsely accused the Canadian government on social media of igniting the fires, posting that its actions were a ploy to convince people of climate change.

Not yet, says Sutherland, but the message should not be ignored.', '“We have a different competition model in Canada for insurance and less intervention from the government like you see, for instance, in California,” Sutherland said.', '“But it is a cautionary tale of the challenges moving forward as the climate continues to change and we see warmer, dryer, hotter summers year after year and the need for more preventative actions to be taken.”', 'He said beyond the government doing more to protect infrastructure and private property from extreme weather damage, Sutherland says individual property owners also have a responsibility to weatherproof their homes, starting with following the Firesmart home safety recommendations. “What is required is a multi-faceted solution beyond just investing in bigger dykes or firebreaks.”', 'About the Author: Barry Gerding', 'Dialogue and debate are integral to a free society and we welcome and encourage you to share your views on the issues of the day.

They deserve to be fired,” Mr. Johnson said in a Jan. 14 post on X (formerly Twiter). “Oversight Chairman Comer and I will be working together to ensure that each federal agency initiates appropriate disciplinary proceedings against any person who walks out on their job,” he added, referring to Rep. James Comer (R-Ky.).', 'The House Speaker’s comments came in response to a tweet by Joyce Karam, the senior news editor at Al-Monitor, saying that “hundreds of U.S. gov. employees plan walkout on Tuesday over Biden’s Gaza policies.” In total, workers from 22 government agencies are expected to be involved in the walkout, she said in a Jan. 13 post.', 'A list obtained by Al-Monitor showed that departments involved in the walkout include the National Security Agency, the Executive Office of the President, the Naval Research Laboratory, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the Departments of State, Defense, Homeland Security, and Veterans Affairs.', 'A walkout by federal employees could count as a strike, which is prohibited per law.', 'Title 5 Section 7311 of the U.S. Code states: “An individual may not accept or hold a position in the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia if he … participates in a strike, or asserts the right to strike, against the Government of the United States or the government of the District of Columbia.”', 'Further, Title 18 Section 1918 prescribes the punishment for such an action. Violators of Section 7311 “shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year and a day, or both.”', 'A major strike by federal employees over four decades ago triggered government action. In 1981, around 13,000 air traffic controllers took part in a strike over pay and work schedules.', 'At the time, President Reagan declared the strike to be a “peril to national safety,” fired 11,000 workers, and barred them from ever joining the federal government again.', 'The walkout is being organized by a group called “Feds United for Peace” who claim that they will mark 100 days of Israel’s operations in Gaza by observing a “day of mourning.” The organizers remained anonymous.', 'One of the organizers of the walkout told Al-Monitor that their initiative “grew out of a collective desire to do what we could to influence the Biden administration’s policy on this issue … What you’re seeing with this effort is something very unusual, and that is for dissent to be manifested via a physical act.”', 'Hamas’ attack in Israel on Oct. 7 had killed around 1,200 individuals and led to the kidnapping of roughly 240 people. It is this attack that triggered the current Israel-Gaza conflict. In October, Israel launched a ground offensive in Gaza.', 'South Africa has accused Israel of committing state-led genocide against Palestinians, claiming at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) that the offensive has led to the deaths of almost 24,000 people.', 'In a Jan. 11 X post, Lior Haiat, a spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, called South Africa’s claims “one of the greatest shows of hypocrisy in history, compounded by a series of false and baseless claims.”', 'South Africa “completely ignored the fact that Hamas terrorists infiltrated Israel, murdered, executed, massacred, raped, and abducted Israeli citizens, simply because they were Israelis, in an attempt to carry out genocide,” he wrote.', '“Hamas’ representatives in the court, the South African lawyers, are also ignoring the fact that Hamas uses the civilian population in Gaza as human shields and operates from within hospitals, schools, UN shelters, mosques, and churches with the intention of endangering the lives of the residents of the Gaza Strip.”', 'This isn’t the first time that federal employees have been entangled in a controversy over the Israel-Hamas conflict.', 'On Nov. 28, Sen.

They also had to dodge cables and chains from the vessel’s rigging that had fallen into the water because the Tara Lynn II was listing so heavily.Advertisement', 'On the third attempt, Perry was able to pause just long enough alongside the 49-foot fishing vessel – grabbing hold of the boat to keep from drifting away – so two of the four people could jump into the 10-foot inflatable rescue boat. The inflatable was not large enough to rescue all four in one trip.', '“The (inflatable) boat was full of water and taking on waves,” Perry said. “We realized the subjects were going to need to be ready to jump. It was very quick once we pulled alongside. It took 10 seconds and they jumped in, one after the other. As soon as they touched down, we told them to sit as low as possible and hang on.”', 'On the second trip, rescue swimmer Eric Laszlo accompanied Perry to retrieve the other two crew aboard the fishing boat.

"Gaza City, Israel (General), Israel",17-01-2024,"['RAFAH, Gaza Strip (AP) — Palestinian militants battled Israeli forces in devastated northern Gaza and launched a barrage of rockets from farther south Tuesday in a show of force more than 100 days into Israel’s massive air and ground campaign against the tiny coastal enclave.', 'The fighting in the north, which was the first target of Israel’s offensive and where entire neighborhoods have been pulverized, showed how far Israel is from achieving its goals of dismantling Hamas and returning scores of hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the war.', 'In other developments, France and Qatar, the Persian Gulf nation that helped mediate a previous cease-fire, said late Tuesday that they had brokered a deal between Israel and Hamas to deliver medicine to Israeli hostages in Gaza, as well as additional aid to Palestinians in the besieged territory.', 'France said it had been working since October on the deal, which will provide three months’ worth of medication for 45 hostages with chronic illnesses, as well as other medicines and vitamins. The medicines are expected to enter Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday.', 'It was the first known agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong truce in November.', 'Meanwhile, Gaza’s humanitarian crisis is worsening, with 85% of the territory’s 2.3 million Palestinians having fled their homes and United Nations agencies warning of mass starvation and disease. The conflict threatens to widen after the United States and Israel traded strikes with Iranian-backed groups across the region.', 'Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’ military and governing capabilities to ensure that the Oct. 7 attack is never repeated. Militants stormed into Israel from Gaza that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 people hostage. With strong diplomatic and military support from the United States, Israel has resisted international calls for a cease-fire.', 'Nearly half of the hostages were released during the truce, but more than 100 remain in captivity. Hamas has said it will not release any others until Israel ends the war.', 'The longer the war goes on, the more it threatens to ignite other fronts across the region.', 'Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli “spy headquarters” in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S. Consulate in Irbil, the seat of Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Iraq and the U.S. condemned the strikes, which killed several civilians, and Baghdad recalled its ambassador to Iran in protest.', 'Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria have carried out dozens of attacks on bases housing U.S. forces, and a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad killed an Iranian-backed militia leader in early January.', 'Elsewhere, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen have resumed their attacks on container ships in the Red Sea following a wave of U.S.-led strikes last week. The U.S. military carried out another strike Tuesday. Separately, it said two Navy SEALS are missing after a raid last week on a ship carrying Iranian-made missile parts and weapons bound for Yemen.', 'Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group have exchanged fire along the border nearly every day since the war in Gaza began. The strikes and counterstrikes have grown more severe since an Israeli strike killed Hamas’ deputy political leader in Beirut this month, raising fears of a repeat of the 2006 war.', 'In Gaza, the Israeli military said its forces located some 100 rocket installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets in the area of Beit Lahiya, a town on the territory’s northern edge. Israeli forces killed dozens of militants during the operation, the military said, without providing evidence.', 'Mahmoud Abdel-Ghani, who lives in Beit Lahiya, said Israeli airstrikes hit several buildings on the eastern side of the town.', 'Hundreds of thousands of people fled northern Gaza, including Gaza City, following Israeli evacuation orders in October. Israel shut off water to the north in the opening days of the war, and hardly any aid has been allowed into the area, even as tens of thousands of people have remained there.', 'Residents reached by phone Tuesday described the heaviest fighting in weeks in Gaza City.', '“The bombing never stopped,” said Faris Abu Abbas, who lives in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. “The resistance is here and didn’t leave.”', 'Ayoub Saad, who lives near Shifa Hospital downtown, said he heard gunfire and shelling overnight and into Tuesday and saw dead and wounded people being brought to the hospital on carts.', 'After weeks of heavy fighting across northern Gaza, Israeli officials said at the start of the year that they were scaling back operations there. The focus shifted to the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel’s creation.', 'But there too, they have encountered heavy resistance. The military said at least 25 rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday, damaging a store in one of the strongest bombardments in more than a week. Israel’s Channel 12 television said the rockets were launched from the Bureij camp in central Gaza.', 'Gaza’s Health Ministry said Tuesday that the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, bringing the war’s overall death toll to 24,285. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.', 'Senior U.N. officials warned Monday that Gaza faces widespread famine and disease if more aid is not allowed in. While they did not directly blame Israel, they said aid delivery is hobbled by the opening of too few border crossings, a slow vetting process, and continuing fighting throughout the territory — all of which is largely under Israel’s control.', 'U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said U.N. agencies and their partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.” At least 152 U.N. staffers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.', 'Israeli officials say they have placed no limits on humanitarian aid and have called on the U.N. to provide more workers and trucks to accelerate delivery.', 'Israel completely sealed off Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and only relented under U.S. pressure. The United States, as well as the United Nations, have continued to push Israel to alleviate the flow of aid.', 'Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 190 of its own soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.', '___', 'Magdy reported from Cairo.
