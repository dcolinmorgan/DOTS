The commando suffered injuries on his legs, another police official said.The jawan was part of a squad that was involved in the same anti-Naxalite operation but it was not engaged in the gun-battle, he added.Notably, Naxalites carry out the Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC) in summers between March and June every year and step up their activities. Several attacks have been carried out against security forces in the Bastar region during this period.On March 27, six Naxalites were killed in an encounter with security forces in the Basaguda area of Bijapur, police earlier said.With the latest gunfight, 43 Naxalites have been killed so far this year in separate encounters with security forces in the Bastar region, comprising seven districts, including Bijapur, police said.
