The medicines are expected to enter Gaza from Egypt on Wednesday.",It was the first known agreement between the warring sides since a weeklong truce in November.,Get the latest breaking news as it happens.,,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy.","Meanwhile, Gaza's humanitarian crisis is worsening, with 85% of the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians having fled their homes and U.N. agencies warning of mass starvation and disease. The conflict threatens to widen after the U.S. and Israel traded strikes with Iranian-backed groups across the region. ","Israel has vowed to crush Hamas’ military and governing capabilities to ensure that the Oct. 7 attack is never repeated. Militants stormed into Israel from Gaza that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and capturing around 250 people. With strong diplomatic and military support from the United States, Israel has resisted international calls for a cease-fire.","A Palestinian looks at the destruction after an Israeli strike at a residential building in Deir al Balah, Gaza Strip, Sunday, Jan. 14, 2024.

Hamas has said it will not release any others until Israel ends the war.",STRIKES AND COUNTERSTRIKES ACROSS THE REGION,"The longer the war goes on, the more it threatens to ignite other fronts across the region.","Iran fired missiles late Monday at what it said were Israeli “spy headquarters” in an upscale neighborhood near the sprawling U.S. Consulate in Irbil, the seat of Iraq’s northern semi-autonomous Kurdish region. Iraq and the U.S. condemned the strikes, which killed several civilians, and Baghdad recalled its ambassador to Iran in protest.","Israeli security forces search for assailants near the scene of a deadly car-ramming and stabbing attack at a bus stop, in Ra'anana, Israel, Monday, Jan. 15, 2024.

The U.S. military carried out another strike Tuesday. Separately, it said two Navy SEALS are missing after a raid last week on a ship carrying Iranian-made missile parts and weapons bound for Yemen.","Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group have exchanged fire along the border nearly every day since the war in Gaza began. The strikes and counterstrikes have grown more severe since an Israeli strike killed Hamas' deputy political leader in Beirut this month, raising fears of a repeat of the 2006 war.",MILITANTS KEEP FIGHTING IN GAZA'S HARD-HIT NORTH,"In Gaza, the Israeli military said its forces located some 100 rocket installations and 60 ready-to-use rockets in the area of Beit Lahiya, a town on the territory's northern edge. Israeli forces killed dozens of militants during the operation, the military said, without providing evidence.","Mahmoud Abdel-Ghani, who lives in Beit Lahiya, said Israeli airstrikes hit several buildings on the eastern side of the town.","Hundreds of thousands of people fled northern Gaza, including Gaza City, following Israeli evacuation orders in October. Israel shut off water to the north in the opening days of the war, and hardly any aid has been allowed into the area, even as tens of thousands of people have remained there.",Residents reached by phone Tuesday described the heaviest fighting in weeks in Gaza City.,"“The bombing never stopped,” said Faris Abu Abbas, who lives in the Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. “The resistance is here and didn’t leave.”","Ayoub Saad, who lives near Shifa Hospital downtown, said he heard gunfire and shelling overnight and into Tuesday and saw dead and wounded people being brought to the hospital on carts.","After weeks of heavy fighting across northern Gaza, Israeli officials said at the start of the year that they were scaling back operations there. The focus shifted to the southern city of Khan Younis and built-up refugee camps in central Gaza dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation.","But there too, they have encountered heavy resistance. The military said at least 25 rockets were fired into Israel on Tuesday, damaging a store in one of the strongest bombardments in more than a week. Israel's Channel 12 television said the rockets were launched from the Bureij camp in central Gaza.",A SPIRALING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS," Gaza’s Health Ministry said Tuesday that the bodies of 158 people killed in Israeli strikes have been brought to hospitals in the past 24 hours, bringing the war's overall death toll to 24,285. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths but says around two-thirds of those killed were women and children.","Senior U.N. officials warned Monday that Gaza faces widespread famine and disease if more aid is not allowed in. While they did not directly blame Israel, they said aid delivery is hobbled by the opening of too few border crossings, a slow vetting process, and continuing fighting throughout the territory — all of which is largely under Israel's control.","U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said U.N. agencies and their partners “cannot effectively deliver humanitarian aid while Gaza is under such heavy, widespread and unrelenting bombardment.” At least 152 U.N. staffers have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war.",Israeli officials say they have placed no limits on humanitarian aid and have called on the U.N. to provide more workers and trucks to accelerate delivery.,"Israel completely sealed off Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack and only relented under U.S. pressure. The U.S., as well as the U.N., have continued to push Israel to ease the flow of aid.","Israel blames the high civilian death toll on Hamas because it fights in dense residential areas. Israel says its forces have killed roughly 8,000 militants, without providing evidence, and that 190 of its own soldiers have been killed in the Gaza offensive.",___,"Magdy reported from Cairo.

The age of the villa is believed to be around the 1st century A.D., meaning the residents of this gorgeous home likely had a front-row seat to one of the most violent cataclysms in known history.","In 79 A.D., Mount Vesuvius began its famed eruption, destroying the town of Pompeii with a series of pyroclastic flows (superheated ash and debris), and leaving behind the casts of humans caught in its wake.

"Millions of Syrians face hunger with the suspension of all in-kind WFP food aid this month, in part due to major cuts to US funding. US aid cuts of up to 50 percent are expected across all humanitarian sectors in 2024, senior humanitarian sources said.",16 January 2024,"MARSEILLE — Millions of Syrians lost a lifeline this month, after the World Food Program (WFP) suspended all in-kind food assistance across Syria due to an unprecedented budget shortfall, owing in large part to drastic cuts in United States government funding, senior humanitarian sources told Syria Direct.","The United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), through its Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), not only supports United Nations (UN) programs like the WFP, but also directly funds non-governmental organizations in Syria. ","BHA funding cuts of up to 50 percent for many programs are expected this year across all humanitarian sectors, two senior humanitarian sources based in northeastern Syria told Syria Direct. ","“Gaza of course has an impact on Syria,” one humanitarian source said, referring to the humanitarian crisis resulting from Israel’s ongoing war in the Palestinian territory. The other noted that cuts are expected “across all the [humanitarian] sectors,” including “camp-based activities,” with the exception of Al-Hol camp holding families of former Islamic State fighters.","The WFP is funded primarily by governments, alongside private donations. The US, the single largest donor to the WFP, has so far contributed around $207 million in 2024 as of January 15. In 2023, it gave a total of $3 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2022. Germany, the second-largest donor, has contributed $127 million so far this year, in addition to $1.3 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022.","According to the WFP’s 2024-2026 management plan released in late 2023, the UN food body expected to receive $10 billion in 2024, while it projected it needed $22.7 billion for operational requirements.","In Syria, even before the latest WFP cuts, “the level of aid did not correspond to the level of need,” Saleem Algerk, media coordinator at Shafak organization, one of WFP’s implementing partners, told Syria Direct. “Thus, if aid decreases, the difficult humanitarian situation and the number of people under the poverty line will increase,” he added. Ninety percent of Syrians already live below the poverty line.","Direct US funding for NGOs working in Syria poses another stark challenge. In the opposition-held northwest—home to more than four million people, more than half of whom are internally displaced—the US is the largest single donor for service delivery, Nicole Hark, Mercy Corps Country Director for Syria, told Syria Direct. ","For Layla, a 41-year-old mother of six living in a displacement camp in Syria’s opposition-held northwest, losing WFP food aid this month was only the latest blow. ","Initially displaced from their native Hama to Idlib province, her family’s home in the town of Jenderes was destroyed last year in the devastating February 6 earthquake that struck Syria and Turkey. They found themselves displaced once more—this time to a camp.","“Getting by has become very hard,” Layla told Syria Direct. Her husband, who has Hepatitis B, has not been able to work for four years. Each time aid is cut, the family falls further into debt, borrowing money to survive. ","In July 2023, around 45 percent of the  5.5 million Syrians receiving WFP food assistance lost it. Layla’s family still received aid, but distributions were reduced from once a month to once every two months. This month, however, they were completely cut off—among the 3.2 million Syrians still receiving aid after the July cut who have now lost support. ","This follows repeated WFP aid cuts in recent months to Syrians both inside Syria and in neighboring countries—as well as other countries across the world. In 2024, the UN food body faces an unprecedented 60 percent funding shortfall due to increasing needs and decreasing contributions. For 2023, less than half of the $23.5 billion needed to fund its global operations was secured. ","“I wish the aid would come back for the displaced people who left their homes and are staying in camps,” Layla. “We hope it comes back so that we can live.” Her family not only relied on food aid for sustenance, but sold portions to buy bread, medicine and other foods not included in it. ","The WFP estimates that 12.9 million Syrians—more than half of the country’s total population—will go hungry this year, with another 2.6 million people at risk of becoming food insecure. ","One humanitarian source involved in cross-border WFP aid delivery, who asked to remain anonymous, speculated that food assistance could resume, albeit with a reduced scope. The source suggested aid could be delivered directly by the UN body, rather than implementing partners—organizations on the ground funded to distribute assistance on its behalf—as has previously been the case. ","Some direct WFP cross-line shipments to northern Syria, originating from regime-controlled areas rather than delivered across the border from Turkey, have taken place in the past, but with little visibility, the source added. If the WFP were to directly deliver aid, it could mean that all food assistance would be distributed cross-line.","For Syria’s opposition-held northwest, where an estimated 75 percent of the population relies on UN assistance, the way that aid arrives is crucial. Cross-border aid deliveries, rather than cross-line aid originating in regime-held territory, are a way to ensure that vital supplies are not withheld or diverted by Damascus. But the future of cross-border access, by the WFP or other UN agencies, is far from certain. ","Starting in July 2014, a cross-border mechanism established by a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution authorized UN aid shipments into Syria from Turkey without the need for regime authorization. But in July 2023, Russia vetoed the most recent vote to extend the mechanism, leaving authorization for cross-border deliveries under Damascus’ discretion. Following the Russian veto, the Syrian regime granted cross-border access for six months until January 13, 2024.","On January 12, one day before it was set to expire, the UN reached an agreement with Damascus to extend cross-border access for UN aid shipments from Turkey by six months until July 13, 2024. ","However, under the latest agreement, only one border crossing—Bab al-Hawa—will remain open for the full six months. The Bab al-Rai and Bab al-Salama crossings, which were opened with the regime’s authorization following last year’s earthquake, will only be open until February 13, 2024. Their closure will impact the “ease and speed” of aid deliveries, Algerk said, in what he called an “increasingly difficult humanitarian situation.” ","For nearly a decade, UN cross-border access renewals have progressively been shortened: from two years to one year, and finally to six months. Uncertainty about sustained access leads donors to issue short grants that do not allow for “sustainability or long-term planning,” Algerk explained.","In the absence of cross-border access, UN aid shipments would come exclusively via areas controlled by Damascus, which has “a long history in politicizing, manipulating, and weaponizing aid,” Mohamad Katoub, a humanitarian expert, explained. ","Algerk feared “the regime would starve everyone.” In a 2019 report, Human Rights Watch exposed the systematic diversion of aid in favor of regime-affiliated figures and armed groups, as well as the blocking of aid to opposition-controlled areas.","In-kind food assistance is not the only support threatened by dwindling funding and aid cuts. In northwestern Syria, cuts disproportionately affect displacement camps where 1.7 million people reside, Hark of Mercy Corps said. Her organization is among those that have been forced to cease services in camps there. ","The implications for water and sanitation are particularly dire, Hark said. With the end of support for services displaced people rely on such as water pumping stations, “families have no other recourse but to use their limited income to buy water from private sources that lack quality control,” with risks for renewed cholera outbreaks. “Northwestern Syria is facing spikes and ebbs in cholera cases and this will likely exacerbate conditions towards an increase,” she added. ","Since September 2022, when the first cholera outbreak since the Syrian conflict was recorded, northwestern Syria has faced several cholera surges—especially in the aftermath of the February earthquake, culminating in more than 13,000 cases last April.","Read more: Northern Syria’s cholera outbreak spreads, reaches Idlib displacement camps","Amid US aid cuts, one European diplomatic source said he expected regional actors, such as Turkey, to step in to fill the gap. This could mean funding projects by institutional actors like the UN or USAID. For example, Saudi Arabia has provided $100 million in funding to US stabilization projects in northeastern Syria.","It could also mean bypassing international institutions altogether. In the case of the latter, certain areas could be deprived of aid for political reasons. For example, northeastern Syria, which is controlled by Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists, would likely be deprived of aid coming directly from Ankara.","The persistent threat posed by aid cuts is a symptom of a larger, structural problem: For nearly 13 years, the international response to the Syrian crisis has been frozen in an emergency phase, without sustainable solutions.","“The crisis has been ongoing for more than a decade and [yet] we’re still talking about emergency assistance,” one of the humanitarian sources in northeastern Syria said. ","“Donors and UN agencies knew this moment would come one day and did nothing over the years,” Katoub said. He said that Syria programming is still in an emergency phase, rather than early recovery, because the humanitarian aid system is “very bureaucratic and very politicized.”","Early recovery is the transition from humanitarian aid towards development that allows for a “sustainable process of recovery from crisis,” according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This includes the rehabilitation of “markets, livelihoods and services and the state capacities to foster them.” ","According to the senior humanitarian worker in northeastern Syria, resilience programming is “a key exit strategy for regular food assistance” to achieve “sustainability.” This could include “livelihood transitions, capacity development projects, better quality cash programming, and more focus on climate change adaptation,” notably “making agriculture sustainable” in a country that was self-sufficient in food production before the war. ","However, according to Katoub, early recovery programming today accounts for less than 9 percent of what is needed. In its absence, he warned vulnerable communities will remain “dependent on aid,” making the consequences of any aid cuts “horrific.”","Syria Direct is an independent journalism organization that produces timely, credible coverage of Syria while training a small group of highly talented, aspiring Syrian and international journalists in professional news-gathering and accurate, in-depth reporting.

"Lava from a volcanic eruption in southwestern Iceland has streamed into a nearby town, engulfing homes and forcing the evacuation of local residents.
","The Icelandic Meteorological Office said the eruption began just before 8:00 a.m. local time Sunday about a half mile from the town of Grindavík after a series of intense earthquakes.
","A second fissure opened after noon Sunday and sent lava flows into the town, officials said.
","Iceland's president, Guðni Th. Jóhannesson, said in an address to the nation on Sunday that a ""daunting period of upheaval"" had begun for those in the Reykjanes peninsula.
","""We continue to hope for as good an outcome as possible, in the face of these tremendous forces of nature,"" he said.
","This is the second time in a month that a volcano has erupted just outside Grindavík, a coastal town about 25 miles from the Icelandic capital of Reykjavík.
","An eruption on December 18 sent lava spewing into the air, but residents had already been told to leave due to heightened seismic activity.
","Iceland's government said Sunday that Grindavík had been evacuated early that morning and that the eruption isn't expected to reach other populated areas.
","So far no flights have been disrupted, and officials are monitoring threats to infrastructure. At least three homes have either burned down or been overtaken by lava, according to the Icelandic broadcaster RUV.
","The government also said the eruption doesn't present a threat to life.
","But in his speech, Jóhannesson offered his sympathy to the loved ones of Lúðvík Pétursson, a man who went missing in a work accident in Grindavík last week.
","According to Sky News, the 50-year-old Pétursson was filling crevasses formed by volcanic activity and earthquakes when he fell in a crack that had opened after last month's eruption.
","Iceland is a hotspot for seismic activity, with 32 active volcanoes. A volcano erupts roughly every five years in the country, though eruptions have occurred more frequently recently.

"On the night of Thursday 11-Friday 12 January the US and UK militaries bombed sites in Yemen controlled by the Houthi movement. The stated aim of the action, according to a UK spokesperson, was to, “protect vessels and freedom of navigation [in the Red Sea],” by destroying Houthi military bases, radar installations, drone and missile launch sites.",The US claimed to have hit 28 targets with 150 missiles. The Houthis say there were 72 strikes and five of their fighters were killed. They promised to take revenge on the US.,"The relatively small death toll, if accurate, probably indicates that the sites the US hit had been largely evacuated. The US issued a warning to the Houthis, in advance, and probably has not so far done much damage to Houthi military infrastructure.",Since October the Houthis have launched missile and drone strikes on the Israeli port of Eliat and international shipping in the Red Sea in support of Hamas in Gaza.,"On 19 November Houthi troops landed by helicopter on Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated cargo ship linked to an Israeli billionaire. The hijacked ship was taken to Salif, a port in Western Yemen. ",The Houthis have conducted 27 attacks on civilian ships since mid-October and on the evening of Tuesday 9 January they launched 18 drones and three missiles at UK and US warships which had been sent to the Red Sea to defend the shipping lanes.,"Cargo has been re-routed, and complex supply chains have been disrupted, including, for example, Tesla and Volvo car production in Europe which depends on components shipped from Asia.","The Houthis are Shiite Muslims based in the north of Yemen who currently control most of the inhabited areas of the country, including the capital, Sana’a, which they overran in 2014. The ultra-reactionary movement’s main slogan is, “God is the greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews.”","The Houthis are aligned with Iran, which supplies them with weaponry and training, although they are from different branches of Shiia Islam and are not natural close allies. The Houthis retain their own independent command structures, have a distinct set of priorities, and are not Iranian state puppets.","The Houthis' campaign to support Hamas by targeting ships in the Red Sea is to be condemned. Disrupting the world economy in this way, for these reasons, is not a progressive act “against imperialism” or a “defence of the Palestinians.” These are actions of a religious-military dictatorship motivated by ideological sympathy for the Hamas pogrom against Israeli Jews.","But it is not clear that the US-UK military action will help – that it will stop the Houthis, who seem to be looking for a confrontation. The Houthi movement has just emerged from a long-running war with a Saudi-UAE-led coalition. They have built a sophisticated, large and adaptable military machine.","The Saudis aimed to smash the Iran-backed movement and launched 25,000 airstrikes on Yemen over seven years after 2015. The Houthis saw off the Saudis and UAE troops, and emerged stronger and much better armed. The Saudi action pushed the Houthis closer to Iran.",The US-UK action has strengthened the Houthis’ position inside Yemen. There was an enormous demonstration against the Western bombing in Sana’a on Friday 12 January.,The Western powers have also made a regional war more likely.,"What the US and its allies should do, positively, is openly demand that the Israeli government stops the war in Gaza and offers the Palestinians a free, independent state alongside Israel. That is the right thing for the Palestinians, who are harmed by association with the Houthi movement. A Two States settlement would undercut the Houthis politically.","A ceasefire agreement, whilst essential, will leave Gaza still in hellish conditions if...",A statement by Sofia Orr explaining her decision to refuse to enlist in the Israeli...,"On 29 February, hundreds of Israelis, Jewish and Palestinians, rallied in Tel Aviv to...",Both Palestinians and Israelis have a right to security and life.,Four councillors have been suspended for defying order to vote against a motion calling...,"The Alliance for Workers' Liberty is an organisation fighting as part of the labour movement for a socialist alternative to both capitalism and Stalinism, based on common ownership and democracy.",020 7394 8923     awl@workersliberty.org,Copyright 2023 Workers’ Liberty,Subscribe to email list,"This website uses cookies, you can find out more and set your preferences here.
