Syria,16-01-2024,"['Millions of Syrians face hunger with the suspension of all in-kind WFP food aid this month, in part due to major cuts to US funding. US aid cuts of up to 50 percent are expected across all humanitarian sectors in 2024, senior humanitarian sources said.', '16 January 2024', 'MARSEILLE — Millions of Syrians lost a lifeline this month, after the World Food Program (WFP) suspended all in-kind food assistance across Syria due to an unprecedented budget shortfall, owing in large part to drastic cuts in United States government funding, senior humanitarian sources told Syria Direct.', 'The United States Agency for International Aid (USAID), through its Bureau of Humanitarian Assistance (BHA), not only supports United Nations (UN) programs like the WFP, but also directly funds non-governmental organizations in Syria.\xa0', 'BHA funding cuts of up to 50 percent for many programs are expected this year across all humanitarian sectors, two senior humanitarian sources based in northeastern Syria told Syria Direct.\xa0', '“Gaza of course has an impact on Syria,” one humanitarian source said, referring to the humanitarian crisis resulting from Israel’s ongoing war in the Palestinian territory. The other noted that cuts are expected “across all the [humanitarian] sectors,” including “camp-based activities,” with the exception of Al-Hol camp holding families of former Islamic State fighters.', 'The WFP is funded primarily by governments, alongside private donations. The US, the single largest donor to the WFP, has so far contributed around $207 million in 2024 as of January 15. In 2023, it gave a total of $3 billion, down from $7.2 billion in 2022. Germany, the second-largest donor, has contributed $127 million so far this year, in addition to $1.3 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022.', 'According to the WFP’s 2024-2026 management plan released in late 2023, the UN food body expected to receive $10 billion in 2024, while it projected it needed $22.7 billion for operational requirements.', 'In Syria, even before the latest WFP cuts, “the level of aid did not correspond to the level of need,” Saleem Algerk, media coordinator at Shafak organization, one of WFP’s implementing partners, told Syria Direct. “Thus, if aid decreases, the difficult humanitarian situation and the number of people under the poverty line will increase,” he added. Ninety percent of Syrians already live below the poverty line.', 'Direct US funding for NGOs working in Syria poses another stark challenge. In the opposition-held northwest—home to more than four million people, more than half of whom are internally displaced—the US is the largest single donor for service delivery, Nicole Hark, Mercy Corps Country Director for Syria, told Syria Direct.\xa0', 'For Layla, a 41-year-old mother of six living in a displacement camp in Syria’s opposition-held northwest, losing WFP food aid this month was only the latest blow.\xa0', 'Initially displaced from their native Hama to Idlib province, her family’s home in the town of Jenderes was destroyed last year in the devastating February 6 earthquake that struck Syria and Turkey. They found themselves displaced once more—this time to a camp.', '“Getting by has become very hard,” Layla told Syria Direct. Her husband, who has Hepatitis B, has not been able to work for four years. Each time aid is cut, the family falls further into debt, borrowing money to survive.\xa0', 'In July 2023, around 45 percent of the\xa0 5.5 million Syrians receiving WFP food assistance lost it. Layla’s family still received aid, but distributions were reduced from once a month to once every two months. This month, however, they were completely cut off—among the 3.2 million Syrians still receiving aid after the July cut who have now lost support.\xa0', 'This follows repeated WFP aid cuts in recent months to Syrians both inside Syria and in neighboring countries—as well as other countries across the world. In 2024, the UN food body faces an unprecedented 60 percent funding shortfall due to increasing needs and decreasing contributions. For 2023, less than half of the $23.5 billion needed to fund its global operations was secured.\xa0', '“I wish the aid would come back for the displaced people who left their homes and are staying in camps,” Layla. “We hope it comes back so that we can live.” Her family not only relied on food aid for sustenance, but sold portions to buy bread, medicine and other foods not included in it.\xa0', 'The WFP estimates that 12.9 million Syrians—more than half of the country’s total population—will go hungry this year, with another 2.6 million people at risk of becoming food insecure.\xa0', 'One humanitarian source involved in cross-border WFP aid delivery, who asked to remain anonymous, speculated that food assistance could resume, albeit with a reduced scope. The source suggested aid could be delivered directly by the UN body, rather than implementing partners—organizations on the ground funded to distribute assistance on its behalf—as has previously been the case.\xa0', 'Some direct WFP cross-line shipments to northern Syria, originating from regime-controlled areas rather than delivered across the border from Turkey, have taken place in the past, but with little visibility, the source added. If the WFP were to directly deliver aid, it could mean that all food assistance would be distributed cross-line.', 'For Syria’s opposition-held northwest, where an estimated 75 percent of the population relies on UN assistance, the way that aid arrives is crucial. Cross-border aid deliveries, rather than cross-line aid originating in regime-held territory, are a way to ensure that vital supplies are not withheld or diverted by Damascus. But the future of cross-border access, by the WFP or other UN agencies, is far from certain.\xa0', 'Starting in July 2014, a cross-border mechanism established by a UN Security Council (UNSC) resolution authorized UN aid shipments into Syria from Turkey without the need for regime authorization. But in July 2023, Russia vetoed the most recent vote to extend the mechanism, leaving authorization for cross-border deliveries under Damascus’ discretion. Following the Russian veto, the Syrian regime granted cross-border access for six months until January 13, 2024.', 'On January 12, one day before it was set to expire, the UN reached an agreement with Damascus to extend cross-border access for UN aid shipments from Turkey by six months until July 13, 2024.\xa0', 'However, under the latest agreement, only one border crossing—Bab al-Hawa—will remain open for the full six months. The Bab al-Rai and Bab al-Salama crossings, which were opened with the regime’s authorization following last year’s earthquake, will only be open until February 13, 2024. Their closure will impact the “ease and speed” of aid deliveries, Algerk said, in what he called an “increasingly difficult humanitarian situation.”\xa0', 'For nearly a decade, UN cross-border access renewals have progressively been shortened: from two years to one year, and finally to six months. Uncertainty about sustained access leads donors to issue short grants that do not allow for “sustainability or long-term planning,” Algerk explained.', 'In the absence of cross-border access, UN aid shipments would come exclusively via areas controlled by Damascus, which has “a long history in politicizing, manipulating, and weaponizing aid,” Mohamad Katoub, a humanitarian expert, explained.\xa0', 'Algerk feared “the regime would starve everyone.” In a 2019 report, Human Rights Watch exposed the systematic diversion of aid in favor of regime-affiliated figures and armed groups, as well as the blocking of aid to opposition-controlled areas.', 'In-kind food assistance is not the only support threatened by dwindling funding and aid cuts. In northwestern Syria, cuts disproportionately affect displacement camps where 1.7 million people reside, Hark of Mercy Corps said. Her organization is among those that have been forced to cease services in camps there.\xa0', 'The implications for water and sanitation are particularly dire, Hark said. With the end of support for services displaced people rely on such as water pumping stations, “families have no other recourse but to use their limited income to buy water from private sources that lack quality control,” with risks for renewed cholera outbreaks. “Northwestern Syria is facing spikes and ebbs in cholera cases and this will likely exacerbate conditions towards an increase,” she added.\xa0', 'Since September 2022, when the first cholera outbreak since the Syrian conflict was recorded, northwestern Syria has faced several cholera surges—especially in the aftermath of the February earthquake, culminating in more than 13,000 cases last April.', 'Read more: Northern Syria’s cholera outbreak spreads, reaches Idlib displacement camps', 'Amid US aid cuts, one European diplomatic source said he expected regional actors, such as Turkey, to step in to fill the gap. This could mean funding projects by institutional actors like the UN or USAID. For example, Saudi Arabia has provided $100 million in funding to US stabilization projects in northeastern Syria.', 'It could also mean bypassing international institutions altogether. In the case of the latter, certain areas could be deprived of aid for political reasons. For example, northeastern Syria, which is controlled by Kurdish-led forces that Turkey considers terrorists, would likely be deprived of aid coming directly from Ankara.', 'The persistent threat posed by aid cuts is a symptom of a larger, structural problem: For nearly 13 years, the international response to the Syrian crisis has been frozen in an emergency phase, without sustainable solutions.', '“The crisis has been ongoing for more than a decade and [yet] we’re still talking about emergency assistance,” one of the humanitarian sources in northeastern Syria said.\xa0', '“Donors and UN agencies knew this moment would come one day and did nothing over the years,” Katoub said. He said that Syria programming is still in an emergency phase, rather than early recovery, because the humanitarian aid system is “very bureaucratic and very politicized.”', 'Early recovery is the transition from humanitarian aid towards development that allows for a “sustainable process of recovery from crisis,” according to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This includes the rehabilitation of “markets, livelihoods and services and the state capacities to foster them.”\xa0', 'According to the senior humanitarian worker in northeastern Syria, resilience programming is “a key exit strategy for regular food assistance” to achieve “sustainability.” This could include “livelihood transitions, capacity development projects, better quality cash programming, and more focus on climate change adaptation,” notably “making agriculture sustainable” in a country that was self-sufficient in food production before the war.\xa0', 'However, according to Katoub, early recovery programming today accounts for less than 9 percent of what is needed. In its absence, he warned vulnerable communities will remain “dependent on aid,” making the consequences of any aid cuts “horrific.”', 'Syria Direct is an independent journalism organization that produces timely, credible coverage of Syria while training a small group of highly talented, aspiring Syrian and international journalists in professional news-gathering and accurate, in-depth reporting.

,16-01-2024,"['On the night of Thursday 11-Friday 12 January the US and UK militaries bombed sites in Yemen controlled by the Houthi movement. The stated aim of the action, according to a UK spokesperson, was to, “protect vessels and freedom of navigation [in the Red Sea],” by destroying Houthi military bases, radar installations, drone and missile launch sites.', 'The US claimed to have hit 28 targets with 150 missiles. The Houthis say there were 72 strikes and five of their fighters were killed. They promised to take revenge on the US.', 'The relatively small death toll, if accurate, probably indicates that the sites the US hit had been largely evacuated. The US issued a warning to the Houthis, in advance, and probably has not so far done much damage to Houthi military infrastructure.', 'Since October the Houthis have launched missile and drone strikes on the Israeli port of Eliat and international shipping in the Red Sea in support of Hamas in Gaza.', 'On 19 November Houthi troops landed by helicopter on Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated cargo ship linked to an Israeli billionaire. The hijacked ship was taken to Salif, a port in Western Yemen. ', 'The Houthis have conducted 27 attacks on civilian ships since mid-October and on the evening of Tuesday 9 January they launched 18 drones and three missiles at UK and US warships which had been sent to the Red Sea to defend the shipping lanes.', 'Cargo has been re-routed, and complex supply chains have been disrupted, including, for example, Tesla and Volvo car production in Europe which depends on components shipped from Asia.', 'The Houthis are Shiite Muslims based in the north of Yemen who currently control most of the inhabited areas of the country, including the capital, Sana’a, which they overran in 2014. The ultra-reactionary movement’s main slogan is, “God is the greatest, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse the Jews.”', 'The Houthis are aligned with Iran, which supplies them with weaponry and training, although they are from different branches of Shiia Islam and are not natural close allies. The Houthis retain their own independent command structures, have a distinct set of priorities, and are not Iranian state puppets.', ""The Houthis' campaign to support Hamas by targeting ships in the Red Sea is to be condemned. Disrupting the world economy in this way, for these reasons, is not a progressive act “against imperialism” or a “defence of the Palestinians.” These are actions of a religious-military dictatorship motivated by ideological sympathy for the Hamas pogrom against Israeli Jews."", 'But it is not clear that the US-UK military action will help – that it will stop the Houthis, who seem to be looking for a confrontation. The Houthi movement has just emerged from a long-running war with a Saudi-UAE-led coalition. They have built a sophisticated, large and adaptable military machine.', 'The Saudis aimed to smash the Iran-backed movement and launched 25,000 airstrikes on Yemen over seven years after 2015. The Houthis saw off the Saudis and UAE troops, and emerged stronger and much better armed. The Saudi action pushed the Houthis closer to Iran.', 'The US-UK action has strengthened the Houthis’ position inside Yemen. There was an enormous demonstration against the Western bombing in Sana’a on Friday 12 January.', 'The Western powers have also made a regional war more likely.', 'What the US and its allies should do, positively, is openly demand that the Israeli government stops the war in Gaza and offers the Palestinians a free, independent state alongside Israel. That is the right thing for the Palestinians, who are harmed by association with the Houthi movement. A Two States settlement would undercut the Houthis politically.', 'A ceasefire agreement, whilst essential, will leave Gaza still in hellish conditions if...', 'A statement by Sofia Orr explaining her decision to refuse to enlist in the Israeli...', 'On 29 February, hundreds of Israelis, Jewish and Palestinians, rallied in Tel Aviv to...', 'Both Palestinians and Israelis have a right to security and life.', 'Four councillors have been suspended for defying order to vote against a motion calling...', ""The Alliance for Workers' Liberty is an organisation fighting as part of the labour movement for a socialist alternative to both capitalism and Stalinism, based on common ownership and democracy."", '020 7394 8923 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0awl@workersliberty.org', 'Copyright 2023 Workers’ Liberty', 'Subscribe to email list', 'This website uses cookies, you can find out more and set your preferences here.

Smoke may be present throughout the Lake Tahoe Basin and surrounding areas.', 'View smoke management tips and the current air quality index at AirNow and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Forest Service Fire and Smoke Map. View the prescribed fire map with project details and locations at Tahoe Living With Fire. To be added to the prescribed fire notification list, send us an email, sm.fs.paltbmu@usda.gov.', 'Prescribed fires are a vital forest management tool used by land managers to help protect communities by removing fuels that can feed unwanted wildland fires. Burning excess vegetation also benefits forest health by making room for new growth which provides forage for wildlife, recycling nutrients back into the soil and reducing the spread of insects and disease.', 'Prescribed fire managers use different methods to remove excess vegetation (fuels) and reintroduce low-intensity fire into forests through pile, broadcast, and understory burning. Pile burning involves burning slash piles that are constructed by hand or mechanical equipment. Broadcast and understory burning use low-intensity fire to remove fuels under specific environmental conditions with fire confined to a predetermined area.', 'Historically, low-intensity wildfires ignited by lightning or native peoples routinely burned through fire-adapted ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada.', 'These low-intensity fires burned at low temperatures and moved slowly across the ground removing forest debris such as pinecones, needles, limbs, dead and downed trees, and ladder fuels. Watch the Forest Service video for an in-depth explanation of low-intensity fire. Prescribed fires are intended to mimic these naturally occurring low-intensity fires that are essential to fire-adapted ecosystems.', 'Prescribed fires may take place any time of year when conditions are favorable. Winter typically brings cooler temperatures and precipitation, which are ideal for conducting prescribed fire operations. Each operation follows a specialized burn plan, which considers smoke dispersal conditions, temperature, humidity, wind, and vegetation moisture. All this information is used to decide when and where to burn.', 'The TFFT strongly supports the use of prescribed fire under appropriate conditions and works closely with air quality districts to avert smoke impacts on the public. Smoke from prescribed fires is normal and may continue for several days after an ignition depending on the project size, conditions, and weather.', 'Prescribed fire smoke is generally less intense and of much shorter duration than smoke produced by unwanted wildfires. Smoke from prescribed burns, wildfire or wood burning stoves may hang low to the ground at night and in the early morning due to a phenomenon known as a temperature inversion. A temperature inversion is when warm air “caps” cooler air, causing smoke to become trapped in valley bottoms at night and in the early morning.', 'Prior to prescribed fire ignitions, agencies coordinate closely with local and state air quality agencies to monitor weather for favorable conditions that will disperse smoke, conduct test burns before igniting larger areas to verify how well vegetation is consumed and how smoke rises and disperses before proceeding, post signs on roadways in areas affected by prescribed fire operations, email notifications to the prescribed fire notification list, and update the local fire information line at 530-543-2816. The TFFT gives as much advance notice as possible before burning, but some operations may be conducted on short notice due to the small window of opportunity for implementing these projects.', 'Learn more about living in fire-adapted ecosystems at Tahoe Living With Fire and get prepared, get informed, and get involved.', 'Click here to get the latest news sent to\nyour inbox every day', '... or see all stories', 'CARSON CITY — The Nevada Division of Insurance is seeking public input on revisions to Nevada’s essential health benefits plan.', ""Come join Cat O'Brien and Debbie Ballew from Kids & Horses on March 26 at 12:30 p.m. in the Joshua Tree Room at the Carson City Senior Center to learn about Connected Horse (R) workshops."", ""A Fernley man was arrested Wednesday for alleged sex crimes against children, including assault and child pornography, according to the Lyon County Sheriff's Office."", 'The Carson City School Board of Trustees met Tuesday and discussed new health and sex education materials, a budget update, reviewed textual updates and more.', ""A 59-year-old man was arrested Tuesday for suspicion of felony making threats concerning acts of terrorism, according to a Carson City Sheriff's Office booking report."", ""Do you have your green attire all picked out and your corned beef ready to brine?

United States,16-01-2024,"['\n  This is the second volcanic eruption near Grindavík in one month, as the Svartsengi volcanic system has re-awakened.\n', '\n\n          By\n        \n\n            Laura Baisas\n          \n                \n              |\n    \n\n    Published Jan 16, 2024 11:00 AM EST\n    \n\n', 'Lava flows in southwestern Iceland appear to be slowing down, after the second volcanic eruption in one month on January 14. Molten lava destroyed multiple homes in the town of Grindavík, which had been evacuated hours before. There is no danger to the rest of the island, home to roughly 380,000 people and 33 active volcano systems.', '[Related: How the Tonga eruption rang Earth ‘like a bell’]', 'Iceland sits over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the boundary between the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates. The country averages about one volcanic eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive eruption in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. Enormous clouds of ash spewed into the atmosphere, disrupting air travel across the Atlantic Ocean for months. This eruption is not expected to push large quantities of ash into the air and operations at Keflavík Airport are continuing as normal.', 'According to Iceland’s Meteorological Office (IMO), it is still too soon to officially declare the danger from this most recent eruption over and difficult to estimate how long it will last. The IMO said that their GPS sensors continued to detect that the magma conduit beneath Grindavík is expanding in the area. Thermal drone images taken show that the fissures previously mapped southwest of Grindavík have enlarged and considerable hazards still remain in the area.', 'Following the eruption, a series of earthquakes began at 3:00 a.m. local time near Sundhnúksgígar. The earthquakes then migrated southwest towards Grindavík. This seismic swarm opened a lava-spewing fissure by 8 a.m. The fissure spread to within 3,000 feet of the fishing town, which is about 30 miles southwest of the capital city Reykjavik. By noon, another fissure had opened north of Grindavík.', 'Icelandic University volcanologist Þorvaldur Þórðarson, told the Iceland Monitor that eruptive activity shifted from the upper fissure and is creeping closer to Grindavík. If this continues, there are two possible scenarios.', '“One is that if the shift is made, then the activity will continue in the lower fissure,” he said. In this situation, the lava will continue to head towards the town.\xa0', '“The other scenario, which is even worse, is that this is an addition to what is happening in the upper fissure,” he said. “This increases the eruption.”', 'An operation to rescue about 270 sheep stranded in more dangerous locations has also begun. A board member of the Animal Welfare Association of Iceland Anna Berg Samúelsdóttir told The Guardian that authorities were not aware that livestock were still in the danger area initially.', '“We noticed that very expensive things were prioritized higher than animal life, such as such as big machines. They were working on Sunday. The animals were standing inside locked pens,” she said. “They have no water in the pens. There were some animals rescued yesterday evening [by] the owner of 30 sheep. But he had to a fight with the authorities to do it.”', '[Related: Geologists: We’re not ready for volcanoes.]', 'There are no known fatalities from the eruption, but a workman is missing after reportedly falling into a crack opened by the volcano, according to the Associated Press.\xa0', 'In a televised address on January 14, President Gudni Johannesson said that “a daunting period of upheaval has begun on the Reykjanes Peninsula,” where the Svartsengi volcanic system has awakened after close to 800 years. Johannesson urged people to “stand together and have compassion for those who cannot be in their homes.”', 'Grindavík is home to about 3,800 people that was evacuated in November 2023, when a series of earthquakes opened large cracks in the Earth.
