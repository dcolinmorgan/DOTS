       "  None,\n",
       "  'Post-disaster recovery modeling framework\\n\\nThe proposed methodology combines five distinct modules to evaluate the probabilistic post-disaster recovery trajectory of school infrastructure. The interdependence of education and utility lifelines (e.g., water and power networks) is not discussed here because (1) past events have shown that utility networks are quickly fixed following disasters38; (2) due to climate conditions and architecture (i.e., large windows), most schools in tropical countries are not significantly dependent on the power supply; and (3) some of these schools in tropical countries rely mainly on local wells, not municipal water networks39. Interested readers are referred to other studies40 for more information on simulating the interdependence of buildings and utility lifelines.\\n\\nThe first module of the proposed framework entails a hazard analysis to simulate the local hazard intensity measures (e.g., earthquake-induced ground shaking, flood-induced water depth, typhoon-induced wind speeds) at each school-building location for a particular hazard scenario (i.e., a given event). The hazard analysis adequately accounts for the spatial distribution of the intensities throughout the region of interest. The second module of the proposed framework is a post-disaster functionality assessment, which entails simulating the damage state of each school building conditioned on the site-specific hazard intensity measure. Then, each school’s resulting post-disaster functionality level can be estimated depending on the damaged state of each building. The primary functionality indicator considered in this study is education continuity. According to the Comprehensive School Safety (CSS) Targets and Indicators developed by the Global Alliance for Disaster Risk Reduction and Resilience in the Education Sector (GADRRRES)41, the main post-disaster education continuity indicators include: (1) duration of disaster-induced school closure; (2) the number of students displaced from schools; and (3) number of students in TLCs. In line with the CSS indicators, we define functionality level as the proportion of students with continued access to education (either in a permanent or temporary learning center). For each school, this is estimated as the ratio of students with safe and occupiable classrooms to the total number of students in the school. The third module is a decision-making analysis used to assess the feasibility of education continuity in schools using rapid response strategies such as class scheduling, construction/availability of TLCs, and transfer of displaced students to neighboring schools. These rapid mechanisms’ feasibility depends on government policies, available finance mechanisms, and other socioeconomic and political factors. The fourth module accounts for the fact that, in many cases, decision-makers want to achieve competing goals under rigid constraints on time, budget, and workforce to decide on school intervention prioritization. Also, other factors, such as the availability and residual lifespan of temporary school structures, the proximity of displaced pupils to neighboring schools with full functionality, and the number of displaced pupils, are essential. Hence, the fourth module is a MCDM analysis (accounting for the factors above) for intervention prioritization in schools with reduced functionality levels. Lastly, the fifth module is a recovery model used for simulating the recovery time of each damaged school building, accounting for the influence of sociocultural, technical, economic, environmental, and political conditions on post-disaster recovery.\\n\\nThe probabilistic post-disaster recovery analysis generates realizations of recovery trajectories (Q(t)), quantifying how quickly the functionality is restored (rapidity) from the initial post-disaster functionality level Q o , and the functionality recovery time t R (Fig. 1). The model details are provided in the “Methods”.\\n\\nFig. 1: Graphical representation of a community-level recovery trajectory. Q pre is the pre-disaster functionality level; Q o is the initial post-disaster functionality level immediately after the event (i.e., at time t 0 ). The recovery time t R is the time to restore full functionality to the system. Given that the analysis is probabilistic, the generated recovery trajectory is also probabilistic in nature (i.e., multiple realizations of the recovery trajectory are simulated). Full size image\\n\\nPost-disaster functionality in the testbed community\\n\\nAlthough the proposed framework is general and can be applied to any natural hazard of interest, we specifically consider the post-disaster recovery of a community of 80 schools subjected to a significant earthquake event (Fig. 2). The attributes of the schools (including population, location, and building characteristics) are heavily based on the extensive database of 2500 schools collected by the authors in Central Sulawesi42. The selected 80 schools represent the number of schools within two districts. The decision to select a relatively small testbed is based on the concept that disaster management decisions are generally made at the local government level43. Furthermore, the small testbed enables the visualization of the impact of each considered policy at the building level rather than considering low-resolution information over a large grid area. We note that the Central Sulawesi region is prone to cascading hazards. Given the focus of the case study on earthquake-induced ground shaking, the main testbed selection criteria are the low potential for earthquake-induced cascading hazards (e.g., liquefaction, landslides, and tsunami) and the reliability of available information on the schools. An inter-rater analysis was used to assess the reliability of the available information42.\\n\\nFig. 2: Testbed school community adopted in the study. a The map of Central Sulawesi showing Palu City, Sigi, Donggala, and Parigi Mountong regencies.

Pre-code and post-code buildings were constructed before and after the SNI 1726:201244 building code. Credit: Imagery ©2023 TerraMetrics, Map data: Google ©2023. Full size image\\n\\nA total of 280 school buildings are in the selected 80 schools. The 280 school buildings serve 17,055 pupils from the considered community. Of the 80 schools, 51 are primary, and 29 are secondary (Fig. 2). In addition, 89% and 11% are one- and two-story buildings, respectively. The one-story and two-story buildings are confined masonry and infilled reinforced concrete frame buildings, respectively. In addition, 75% and 25% of buildings are assumed to be designed/built pre- and post- the updated Indonesian seismic code (SNI 1726:2012)44, respectively. The number of buildings in the 80 schools ranges from one to nine, with a median of three and a standard deviation of 1.4. The average pupil population in each school building is 61, with a standard deviation of 16.5. For this study, we assume that all schools are state-owned and the same policies apply to all. We note that the boundary around the 80 schools in Fig. 2 is hypothetical (to guarantee the anonymity of each specific school).\\n\\nThe case study is carried out for an M7.0 earthquake scenario assumed to occur on a hypothetical North-Northwest-South-Southeast (NNW-SSE) trending strike-slip fault (Fig. 2). A V s30 of 300 m/s is assumed for the entire community. One thousand realizations of spatially cross-correlated intensity measures (IMs) (i.e., spectral accelerations) at the building locations (and for the building fundamental periods of vibration) are generated, as described in the “Hazard Analysis” section of “Methods”. The post-earthquake functionality assessment follows the modeling approach presented above and described in detail in the “Methods”. Building-level fragility models are used for the post-earthquake functionality assessment. Due to the absence of fragility models for schools in Palu, we selected fragility models based on a review of published studies from similar archetypes in South Asia and globally45,46,47. Based on expert judgment, we concluded that the fragility models from these countries could be adopted in Palu. In addition, we note that the study aims to showcase the proposed framework using realistic input data and discuss the relative effect of various disaster-risk management policies rather than perform a detailed/realistic risk assessment. Additional studies are, however, recommended to develop fragility models for school buildings in Central Sulawesi.\\n\\nDevelopment of case-study scenarios\\n\\nWe now demonstrate how the proposed framework can support stakeholders with disaster management planning by quantifying the influence of various policies on the disaster recovery of their education infrastructure. To ensure we address realistic problems, the case-study scenarios were highlighted from focus group discussions and interviews with school principals, NGO officials, government officials, engineers, and contractors involved in the 2018 Central Sulawesi earthquake recovery projects48. Information related to the stakeholder engagement exercises (including details of the area of inquiry, stakeholder engagement type, guiding questions, and the number of stakeholders) is available online48.\\n\\nFirst, school stakeholders noted that insufficient anticipatory funding was a critical factor in the lack of classrooms for school pupils after the 2018 event. Furthermore, several schools had to rely on local and foreign aid to build TLCs. Stakeholders noted that school communities might respond better to disasters if there were tools to forecast the amount of anticipatory funding required.\\n\\nAnother issue highlighted was the delay in reconstructing permanent school buildings in projects handled by NGOs. Due to this delay, almost four years since the earthquake, several schools still use TLCs (typically with a lifespan of 4–5 years). As a result, several schools may be susceptible to increased education discontinuity if TLCs start experiencing damage and loss of functionality.\\n\\nLastly, NGO officials discussed that they do not have a systematic method of selecting schools to focus on for their reconstruction projects. The primary criterion considered was the availability of well-cleared land for their projects. Due to delays in NGO projects, this approach may be unfavorable to schools with significant reliance on TLCs, especially if such schools could have otherwise benefitted from other management types (e.g., community-led management).\\n\\nThe subsequent subsections in this paper adopt the three highlighted discussions in demonstrating the applicability of our proposed framework to capture multi-dimensional issues affecting recovery.\\n\\nInfluence of available early response financing mechanisms on education continuity\\n\\nThe most appropriate way to achieve a desirable post-disaster education continuity level is through the effective retrofit/reconstruction of school buildings in a pre-disaster scenario. However, several school buildings will remain vulnerable due to a lack of financial resources and sufficient technical know-how to identify disaster-prone structures. A helpful way for local authorities to plan for post-disaster education continuity is through early response financing mechanisms49. Such funding can be used for interventions such as repairing and retrofitting damaged school buildings, constructing TLCs, and buying relevant learning materials.\\n\\nUsing the proposed framework, we demonstrate how local authorities can estimate a given school’s education continuity recovery trajectory (through the construction of TLCs), accounting for the uncertainties involved in the process. We assumed that because they are ‘makeshift’ structures (i.e., tents), TLCs are typically non-engineered and do not require skilled labor or heavy equipment for their construction. Hence, the technical factors that affect the construction of permanent structures (where building permits are needed, the tender process may be necessary, and lack of building materials and technical know-how are more influential) are not significant for TLCs. Although not considered in this analysis, we note that the proposed methodology can capture the influence of other recovery-impeding factors on the construction of TLCs.\\n\\nEngagement with the school principals48 showed that some schools could carry out immediate post-disaster intervention using anticipatory funding set aside from the school operational assistance funding (locally referred to as Bantuan Operasional Sekolah (BOS)) provided by the government. More information on BOS can be found online50. We observed that not all schools had this anticipatory funding, which impacted their recovery.\\n\\nFigure 3 illustrates two cases of available anticipatory funding for the schools subjected to the considered M7.0 scenario for the median IM realization. The first is a case where 45% of the 80 schools have anticipatory funding. Without any model to simulate the capability of principals to set aside anticipatory funding, we randomly assigned anticipatory funding to 36 schools in the testbed. In reality, such data can be collected by surveying school principals in a region of interest. Based on field data from the 2018 Palu earthquake, we assume that the average time to construct a TLC with early finance mechanisms is 40 days after the disaster. Using a time mitigation factor of 0.5 (i.e., for community participaton - described in “Methods”), the optimistic time a is taken as 20 days. The pessimistic time b is taken as 80 days by assuming a time amplification factor, associated with delay in material procurement, of 2.0. The most likely time m is taken as the average of the sum of a and b (see discussions in “Methods”). For schools without access to early response financing mechanisms, we assume that a, m, and b are further amplified by a factor of 2.0 (i.e., due to delays in funds disbursement) – i.e., a = 40 days, m = 100 days, and b = 160 days. As shown in Fig. 3a, in a case where only 45% of the 80 schools have early response financing mechanisms, only a small fraction of the schools can ensure education continuity within two months, and the remaining schools may need to rely on foreign aid to construct TLCs, resulting in an undesirable recovery rapidity level. On the other hand, sufficient anticipatory funding (i.e., all 80 schools have anticipatory funding) allows all the damaged school buildings to be immediately replaced by TLCs. For the case-study community, we show that sufficient anticipatory funding can reduce the recovery time for education continuity (through rapid construction of TLCs) by a factor of up to three.\\n\\nFig. 3: Recovery trajectories for the considered budget availability scenarios for the median ground-motion intensity field. a The effect of minimal anticipatory funding (i.e., only 45% of all schools have funding); b the effect of sufficient anticipatory funding (i.e., all schools have funding). The dashed boxes show the influence range of the funding mechanisms. Full size image\\n\\nOne of the advantages of this scenario analysis is that local authorities can easily use a target hazard scenario, given the vulnerabilities of schools in their communities, to plan for sufficient early response financing for TLC construction while still making pre-disaster efforts to mitigate the vulnerabilities of the schools (e.g., retrofitting).\\n\\nInfluence of management type on the reconstruction time for permanent school buildings\\n\\nThe government, NGOs (both local and international), or the host communities typically provide/contribute to post-disaster school reconstruction project funding. Post-disaster recovery reports33 in major global disasters show that most permanent school-building reconstruction projects are either community- or agency-managed. The community-managed approach is a locally implemented approach where the construction management (e.g., material acquisition, selection of building contractors) is led by local authorities, school management committees, or host community leaders. The agency-managed approach is a case where a government or non-government entity leads the construction management.\\n\\nSeveral field-based comparative studies33,48,51,52,53,54 have highlighted the successes and weaknesses of community-managed and agency-managed reconstruction projects (residential and school buildings) in lower-middle-income countries. For example, the abundance of local knowledge and experience positively influences the recovery process of community-managed projects and achieves higher beneficiary satisfaction. Also, the fact that the drivers of community-managed projects (i.e., local authorities, school management committees, or host community leaders) typically reside in the communities is a strong motivation to ensure higher quality and rapidity in reconstruction projects. On the other hand, the agency-managed approach has been described as a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach intended to suit donors and implementing agencies and rarely involves the target beneficiaries51,52. Typically, agency-managed projects are subjected to delays resulting from internal bureaucracy, agreements with the local authorities, community, and school authorities, and the lengthy bidding process for engineers and contractors. Nevertheless, regardless of the management type, a given time is spent on damage assessment, clearing the site of rubbles (or identifying a relocation site), getting the relevant building permits, and so on. We note that principal interviews and focus group discussions with key stakeholders (engineers, contractors, government, and NGO officials)48 actively involved in the recovery process of the post-2018 Palu earthquake highlighted significant delays of agency-managed projects in Palu.\\n\\nConsidering all these impeding factors in the recovery modeling framework, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the simulated post-disaster reconstruction time for a school building from community- and agency-managed projects can be assessed as presented in Fig. 4. We explicitly account for the influence of delayed bidding process, internal bureaucracy on the bidding, and construction mobilization of agency-managed projects through recovery time amplification factors described in “Methods”. In line with the earlier discussions, these challenges are assumed to be less prominent in community-managed projects and are not considered in the recovery time modeling process (See Table 2). In a pre-disaster scenario, the required time to construct a typical one-story school building in Palu is 4–6 months48 (see “Methods” for more information). As shown in Fig. 4, community-managed projects, on average, would be completed more than two times slower than in a pre-disaster scenario.\\n\\nFig. 4: Impact of management type on reconstruction time of permanent school buildings. Simulated cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the reconstruction time for community-managed (median of 310 days) and agency-managed (median of 860 days) projects. The reconstruction times in the testbed community are estimated using the recovery time model presented in Eqs. (3)–(5). The CDF accounts for recovery-impeding (i.e., time amplification) factors that may influence both community- and agency-managed projects. The community-managed school building projects have a lower median recovery time because of little to no internal bureaucratic issues, more coordinated arrangements with relevant stakeholders, and little to no delay in a contract bidding process in these types of projects. The range of completion times for community-managed building reconstruction in 16 schools in Palu (after the 2018 earthquake) is shown in the blue box. The green and cyan lines show the start and contract termination date for one of the prominent NGOs handling reconstruction projects in over 20 schools in Palu48. Full size image\\n\\nWe note that we interviewed 16 school principals with reconstruction projects in their schools and discovered that the completion time ranged from 180 to 400 days48. This range is effectively captured in Fig. 4, providing some evidence of the validity of our proposed framework. We can compare the observed recovery time of collapsed buildings in Palu with the simulated recovery time because the recovery time models are conditioned on the post-earthquake damage state and not the earthquake scenario (i.e., ground-motion intensities).\\n\\nOn the other hand, as shown in Fig. 4, agency-managed projects are likely to be completed 2–4 years after the disaster. We also assessed ongoing agency-managed reconstruction projects in Palu by interviewing NGO officials and contractors. For an unnamed NGO with a significant number of school reconstruction projects in the Palu region, most reconstruction sites have not yet been reached four years after the disaster. More details are provided in Opabola et al.48. Hence, constructing permanent structures in those schools may take up to five years or more.\\n\\nA key recommendation from this case study is that the government needs to understand that agency-managed projects may be delayed. As such, local authorities may only consider allowing NGOs to manage the reconstruction of schools that a prolonged reconstruction process would impact less. Further discussions on this are provided in the subsequent case study scenario. Furthermore, the efficiency of agency-managed projects can be improved through more trust and collaboration with local communities. For example, NGOs may choose to disburse funds to support efficient community-managed reconstruction projects rather than manage projects themselves.\\n\\nAccounting for the influence of sociocultural, environmental, and political on the recovery process\\n\\nApart from the typical technical and financial delays in the recovery process, sociocultural, environmental, and political issues may impede or speed up recovery. For example, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, recovery projects in conflict zones in Sri Lanka were eight times slower than in areas without conflicts55. Being able to account for such sociocultural and political factors can enable local authorities to understand how existing issues could further impede recovery in their zones. The proposed methodology accounts for these conditions through amplification factors calibrated using data from past events. These factors are applied to the relevant intervention process, as described in the “Methods” section.\\n\\nUsing the proposed methodology, we explore how a combination of sociocultural, environmental, and political issues can influence the average reconstruction time for community-managed and agency-managed projects. Five factors were considered—(1) hostile political conditions; (2) pandemic; (3) land disputes (for relocation projects); (4) poor management skills of contractors; (5) a combination of land disputes and poor management skills of contractors. For this analysis, the average mobilization and inspection time for the community- and agency-managed projects are combined with time amplification factors using Eqs. (3)–(5) in a probabilistic manner (see description in “Methods”).\\n\\nFigure 5 presents the output of the probabilistic analysis and shows how various sociocultural, environmental, and political conditions can impede school reconstruction projects. For the considered scenarios, hostile political conditions resulted in the longest recovery time for permanent school buildings. As shown in Fig 5, the estimated median recovery time for reconstructing a damaged school building is significantly influenced by the management type and the considered recovery impeding factors. For the considered scenarios, hostile political conditions resulted in the longest recovery time for permanent school buildings. For example, local authorities may decide to encourage only community-managed projects in regions with hostile political conditions based on the information presented in Fig. 5.\\n\\nFig. 5: Influence of sociocultural, environmental, and political factors on the median post-disaster reconstruction time for school buildings. The following amplification factors (β) were used in the simulation: hostile political conditions (β = 5.0); pandemic (β = 3.0); land dispute (β = 2.0); poor management skills of contractors (β = 3.0); a combination of land dispute and poor management skills of contractors (β = 3.0). The time amplification factors used in simulating the influence of these conditions in Eqs. (3)–(5) are based on Supplementary Table 3. For each of the five scenarios, the optimistic time (a) was estimated using a time mitigation factor of 0.5, while the pessimistic time (b) is based on the upper-bound values of the time amplification factors in Supplementary Table 3, and m (most likely time) is taken as 0.5(a+b). Full size image\\n\\nInfluence of decision-makers’ preferences on school reconstruction prioritization\\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, during the interviews, NGO officials involved in reconstruction projects discussed the lack of a systematic methodology for developing a school reconstruction prioritization list. The proposed framework includes a MCDM module that can support the government or NGOs in creating such a school reconstruction prioritization list. However, it is noted that the prioritization list depends on the weights decision-makers append to each criterion. Therefore, criteria weights for developing the prioritization list are selected based on subjective judgment. Nevertheless, decision-makers can use our methodology to perform sensitivity analyses and see how the prioritization hierarchy fluctuates for a given suite of criteria weights.\\n\\nFigure 6 describes a case study where decision-makers are interested in four criteria (described in “Methods”) and three scenarios. The first scenario is where the decision-makers consider the level of a school’s reliance on TLCs as the primary criterion for identifying schools that need to be prioritized for permanent structures’ (re)construction. The second scenario examines a case where affordability is considered the most important criterion, while the third scenario looks at a case where all four criteria are equally weighted (i.e., zero bias).\\n\\nFig. 6: Criteria weights for the considered scenarios for the multicriteria decision-making analysis. Scenario 1 is a case where decision-makers consider the level of a school’s reliance on temporary learning centers as the primary criterion for identifying schools that need to be prioritized for permanent structures’ (re)construction. Scenario 2 is a case where affordability is considered the most important criterion, while Scenario 3 looks at a case where all four criteria are equally weighted. Full size image\\n\\nFigure 7a looks at defined performance metrics for the 15 damaged schools with average post-disaster functionality lower than 0.33. Further discussions on how the criteria and performance metrics are defined are provided in “Methods”. Using the proposed approach, Fig. 7b provides the reconstruction prioritization hierarchy for each scenario. As shown in Fig. 7b, the selected weights significantly influence the list. As shown in Fig. 7a, School 15 is an elementary school that relies heavily on temporary structures, but the reconstruction project would take 27% of the available budget. For scenario 1 (preference for schools relying on temporary structures), School 15 gets prioritized (Fig. 7b). However, in scenario 2 where the decision-makers choose not to prioritize the most capital-intensive projects, School 15 drops in the prioritization order. The MCDM can enable decision-makers to visualize whether their bias (reflected in criteria weights) results in inclusive recovery.\\n\\nFig. 7: School reconstruction prioritization analysis. a Performance metrics for the 15 damaged schools used in the multicriteria decision-making analysis. b Reconstruction prioritization hierarchy for the 15 damaged schools based on the three considered scenarios. A rank value of one means highest priority and a rank value of 15 means lowest priority. The criteria weights for each scenario are defined in Fig. 6. Full size image\\n\\nLocal authorities can use the reconstruction prioritization list to designate school intervention projects to different management types. For example, schools ranking low in the prioritization list may be designated as agency-managed projects. It is also noted that the ranking list can always be updated by repeating the analyses whenever local authorities update the performance metrics and/or criteria weights.'],\n",

       " ['Recovering from natural disasters is slow and bureaucratic. New FEMA rules aim to cut the red tape',\n",
       "  '19-01-2024',\n",
       "  'WASHINGTON (AP) — Anyone who has lived through a natural disaster and then applied to the federal government for assistance knows that it can be a lengthy, frustrating and bureaucratic process. New rules announced Friday by the federal agency in charge of emergency management aim to simplify and speed up the process.\\n\\nWith natural disasters now affecting more people across the United States, insurance markets in many states are buckling under the weight of payouts to those hit by wildfires and hurricanes.\\n\\nDeanne Criswell, who heads the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the changes, going into effect in March, are designed to make it easier for disaster survivors to get help — a challenge for those often struggling to recover from the worst day of their lives.\\n\\n“Mother Nature is not letting up,” Criswell said to reporters on a call announcing the changes. “We need to be better prepared and better informed to recover from natural disasters faster and more effectively.”\\n\\nCriswell described the changes as the “most comprehensive update to our individual assistance program in 20 years.” She said the changes were the result of a huge amount of feedback from survivors, organizations that work in disaster recovery, and elected officials.\\n\\nHere are some of the changes outlined by FEMA:\\n\\nHELP FOR HOMEOWNERS WITH NOT ENOUGH INSURANCE\\n\\nUnder previous rules, homeowners who had received payments from their insurance company for home repairs but not enough to cover all of the damage were essentially out of luck when it came to getting help from FEMA. Now those homeowners can apply to FEMA for help. Criswell gave an example of a homeowner who has $80,000 in damage but receives only $45,000 from the insurance company. Previously, FEMA couldn’t help them because their insurance payout already exceeded the agency’s assistance cap of $42,500 per disaster. Now, that homeowner can get money from the agency to make up the difference. This rule change comes at a time when homeowners in places like Louisiana, Florida and California are facing skyrocketing deductibles and fights with insurance companies over damage assessments that have made it difficult even for people with insurance to recover from hurricanes or wildfires.\\n\\nSamantha L. Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy, called this change a “pretty massive internal shift” and questioned why it hadn’t been done before. She said survivors are increasingly receiving estimates from insurance companies that are much lower than the cost of repairs or inspectors saying that the damage was pre-existing and as such not covered. That leaves homeowners increasingly in the position that they have to sue their insurance company or figure out how to make up the difference on their own.\\n\\nGETTING RID OF THE LOAN RULE\\n\\nUnder previous rules, disaster survivors first had to apply for a loan with the Small Business Administration and get rejected before they could apply for FEMA assistance. Criswell said survivors found the SBA application requirement “confusing and challenging,” so the agency is eliminating that requirement.\\n\\nAl Cathey, who was mayor of Mexico Beach, Florida, when Hurricane Michael leveled almost every building in the Panhandle beach town in 2018, said he welcomed the changes given the bureaucracy and paperwork he encountered when he went to apply for an SBA loan for his destroyed hardware store.\\n\\nAfter going to a trailer where SBA workers handed him a large packet of papers, and seeing how many people he would have to be interviewed by to get the loan, he decided it wasn’t worth it even though he was about $200,000 short of the money needed to reopen the store.\\n\\n“I got frustrated with them myself. I didn’t want to get involved with all that government red tape,” Cathey said Friday. “I understand the need for guidelines and policies, but, my God, the paperwork they wanted from me to start the approval process. This was a disaster, but you would think they thought I wanted the money for a vacation.”\\n\\nCHANGES TO CRITICAL NEEDS ASSISTANCE\\n\\nThe agency has had something called critical needs assistance, currently $750, that survivors can use for whatever they need right after a disaster: baby formula or food, for example. But states or tribal nations had to specifically request that category of assistance, and it was only done on a case-by-case basis. Now, anytime a disaster is declared that includes FEMA’s individual assistance funding stream, those $750 payments will be available. Survivors still have to apply, and there is some vetting to prevent fraud. But it bypasses the application that states and tribal nations had to make. That doesn’t mean that every disaster will include these payments. Many declared disasters are more limited in scope.\\n\\nOTHER CHANGES\\n\\nDisaster survivors with disabilities can use FEMA money to make changes to their homes to make them more accessible, whereas under previous rules the agency would only pay to rebuild things that had been damaged in the disaster. People with pre-existing problems in their home, like a leaky roof, can now get money from the agency to fix the house. Currently, the agency requires that if it is giving people money to fix something, it had to have worked before the disaster.\\n\\nAnd FEMA is creating a new category of aid called displacement assistance, designed to help those who can’t return to their home. It gives them money for housing while they’re looking for a long-term rental and has flexibility so that they can, for example, use the money to pay a friend’s utilities if they’re crashing on a couch.\\n\\nZack Rosenburg, the co-founder and CEO of St. Bernard Project, which does recovery work across the country, said the changes are a “step in the right direction.” He said the vast majority of people their organization works with in the wake of natural disasters “hate” asking the government for help.\\n\\n“For some, they see it as humiliating. For some, they see it as anathema or inconsistent in who they are. They just don’t like doing it,” he said.\\n\\nAnd then when they do, they encounter a “maze” of requests for information.\\n\\nHe particularly praised the changes getting rid of the mandatory SBA application, efforts to simplify the application process and the changes allowing FEMA money even if people had preexisting problems with their homes: “This will allow more resilient rebuilding.”\\n\\nBut, he said, the details of how the changes are communicated to people will be crucial, and he suggested other things that would help such as making the changes retroactive to people who already have claims in the pipeline. He said the SBP has also been pushing for years for one application that can be used to apply for FEMA, SBA and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which funds longer-term recoveries.\\n\\nOverall, Montano said, these are all “good and needed changes, but we still need to do more.” Like any new government policy, it depends on how things play out once the policies go into effect. And, she said, there’s likely still room to improve things like the appeal process or giving survivors more time to apply for aid. And, she noted, FEMA is one part — albeit an important part — of disaster recovery. She said Congress needs to step in to increase the cap on individual assistance to disaster survivors and there needs to be more oversight of the insurance industry.\\n\\nThe new rules go into effect March 22. The changes are expected to cost $671 million per year, with $159 million of that borne by the states and tribal nations where the disasters occur.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press writer Mike Schneider contributed from Orlando, Fla.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow the AP’s coverage of the Federal Emergency Management Agency at https://apnews.com/hub/federal-emergency-management-agency.'],\n",

       "  '19-01-2024',\n",
       "  'Responding to frustrations from impacted communities across the United States, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Friday that it is making sweeping changes so that more disaster victims get financial assistance faster and with fewer rules, red tape and delays. “We can do better. Survivors deserve better,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a call with reporters. “We are breaking records year after year with these disasters, and we need to be better prepared and informed to recover faster and more effectively.”\\n\\nFEMA, a relatively small agency, largely carries the responsibility of helping states and communities recover from hurricanes, wildfires and other weather-related disasters. This includes helping people find and pay for short-term housing while their state and local governments lead recovery efforts.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe result for many victims, however, has long been a bureaucratic nightmare that bounces them between multiple agencies, often resulting in denials and delays of critical funds when they need it most. Thousands of survivors do not get adequate money to find new housing, rebuild what was broken and move forward.\\n\\nAs climate change has made disasters more destructive, frequent and costly, FEMA said that more victims, especially vulnerable populations, have been falling further through the cracks.\\n\\nTo change that, the agency will soon offer more flexible forms of assistance aimed at getting money to people faster. Criswell said that when she took the job in 2021, she started traveling to disaster zones and listening to the frustrations and criticisms from victims, nonprofits and local officials, who repeatedly highlighted how people were left for months struggling to get aid.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExperts and aid organizations say that America’s disaster response, particularly how it addresses immediate housing needs, is broken. It is getting harder for communities to get back on their feet largely because local and state governments are overwhelmed by the scale and cost of recovery, and federal resources have not filled in the gaps. Housing is the linchpin, experts say, for a community to survive and recover after a disaster.\\n\\n“If people lack housing … they end up in unsafe conditions or move away. And if people stay away too long, they may not return,” said Patrick Roberts, a political scientist specializing in disasters with the Rand Corp. “One of the goals of disaster recovery is to return a community to its normal functioning, along with its schools, hospitals, businesses and essential services.”\\n\\nThe Government Accountability Office has criticized the federal government’s sprawling, disjointed approach, noting that such programs are spread across more than 30 federal entities. Several GAO reports have found that disaster survivors often face numerous challenges obtaining aid through FEMA’s program meant to provide for temporary housing or home repairs, and that FEMA could do a better job helping people to better understand eligibility requirements.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHilton Kelley, an environmental and community activist in Port Arthur, Tex., has seen firsthand how his community struggled after several hurricanes battered the area in recent decades — most notably Hurricane Harvey in 2017, which flooded his own home.\\n\\nHe heard over and over how people had to wait months to receive any aid from the agency. They also felt FEMA’s damage assessments were too low, the paperwork too arduous and the aid too paltry, particularly compared with more affluent areas.\\n\\n“A lot of folks had to move away,” Kelley said, noting that some homes became uninhabitable while awaiting repairs. “Many people felt treated unfairly. A lot of people were frustrated and disgusted. They just lost their will to fight.”\\n\\nFEMA is now trying to address such complaints.\\n\\nShare this article Share\\n\\nThe agency’s overhaul of its Individual Assistance program includes nixing steps — such as first making states apply for a cash relief program — that often slowed and complicated federal money getting to victims. Now, its revamped Critical Needs Assistance program will automatically give eligible households $750 to help cover immediate expenses and basic necessities. It has also removed barriers for victims who applied late and has simplified its appeal process.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTo make it easier for people to access housing immediately, FEMA has removed some of its documentation requirements. The agency also is doing away with what Criswell called “onerous documentation” that made victims prove they were spending their aid on rent to make them eligible for continued assistance.\\n\\nDisplaced victims now have the flexibility to choose where they stay, such as with family or friends, and FEMA will give them the money upfront for it instead of making them stay in specified hotels.\\n\\nOne longtime source of confusion was the involvement of the Small Business Administration, with the agency first having to reject a victim’s loan application before the person could get help from FEMA. That’s now gone. Victims with disabilities can also now use FEMA funds to make their homes more accessible after a disaster.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPreviously, if insured residents got a certain amount of money from their carrier, they were ineligible for federal assistance, even if the payout barely put a dent in their repairs. Now, FEMA will pay up to $42,500 toward damage that insurance doesn’t cover.\\n\\n“Accessibility has been a huge obstacle,” said Whitney Bailey, an attorney for the Appalachian Research and Defense Fund of Kentucky, who spends her days helping victims of flood disasters with FEMA appeals. Her clients are often baffled by trying to navigate the maze of disaster aid.\\n\\nFor instance, when FEMA initially rejects an aid application, many folks interpret that as the final decision. Just making more clear that isn’t the case, she said, would be significant.\\n\\n“A lot of people throw their hands up when they receive this ineligibility letter. But it’s not the end,” she said. “Small changes could make a huge impact.”\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDisaster response and recovery nonprofits and victims rights advocates are applauding the reforms, which some had been pushing for years. Team Rubicon, an organization that has been advising the federal government on how to streamline disaster response, said that “these changes will have immediate and significant positive impacts” when the next disaster strikes.\\n\\nThe rule changes go into effect March 22, meaning that victims of a disaster declared on or after that date will benefit from these reforms.\\n\\nKelley, the Texas resident, had not yet seen the details of FEMA’s new changes, but hopes some good comes from the agency’s latest actions.'],\n",

Gretchen Whitmer said the declaration opens the path to Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Individual Assistance (IA) for affected residents.\\n\\n“Michiganders have been working hard to recover from the tornadoes and storms that caused so much damage across the state this summer,” said Whitmer. “With [Thursday’s] federal disaster declaration by President Biden, we will get the resources we need to support impacted families, businesses, and communities. Michiganders are tough. We will get through this the way we always have — together.”\\n\\nThis FEMA assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster. Federal funding will also now be available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.\\n\\nThe stormfront began with severe thunderstorms early on the morning of Aug. 24 that led to flooding, road closures and stranded vehicles in Wayne and Monroe counties. That was followed by even more severe weather later that evening with the National Weather Service (NWS) reporting a total of seven tornadoes across the state.\\n\\nWhile most of the tornadoes were classified as EF-1 or moderate intensity, the tornado in Williamston and Webberville was classified as EF-2, or strong, while the tornado in Canton was classified as EF-0, or weak.\\n\\nAt least five people died as a result, including an 84-year-old woman killed after a tree fell on her house near Lansing, a 21-year-old Kent County woman and two young girls who died in a head-on collision during the rainstorm and a Hartland Township man killed by the Williamston tornado.\\n\\nU.S. Sen.

Hundreds of homeowners also reported residential flooding.\\n\\n“This federal assistance will supplement the ongoing state and local recovery efforts and will directly help home and business owners affected by these storms,” said Col. James F.

       "  None,\n",
       "  'Natural disasters such as hurricanes, tropical storms, tsunamis, and landslides have the potential to generate a tremendous amount of marine debris. The high winds, heavy rains, storm surge, and flooding associated with these disasters can pull large structures, household articles, and outdoor items into surrounding waters.\\n\\nAs seen in the wakes of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and post-tropical cyclone Sandy, some debris remains in shallow waters, creating safety hazards for people, obstructing navigation channels, and threatening natural resources. Immediate action is needed to assess and remove the debris in order to maintain navigation routes, ensure safe boating and recreational activities, and protect sensitive ecosystems.\\n\\nStrong tides and currents also carry the debris out to sea, where it may take months to years to reach land again. The Japan earthquake of 2011 and the resulting tsunami destroyed whole communities, creating an estimated five million tons of debris. Much of this debris remained along the coast of Japan, but a portion of it was washed into the Pacific Ocean. While some of the wreckage eventually sank to the ocean floor, debris from the disaster occasionally continues to appear on U.S. and Canadian shores.'],\n",

Each U.S. region faces a different set of disaster risks each season.\\n\\nBillion-dollar severe storms and floods are generally most common during spring, especially in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, South, Southeast, and Northeast.\\n\\nDuring the summer and fall, billion-dollar wildfires dominate across the western U.S. and tropical cyclones raise risks in the South, Southeast, and Northeast.\\n\\nThe rise in billion-dollar disasters is due both to our warming climate and to the growing number of people, homes, and businesses in at-risk areas.\\n\\nAn unprecedented year of billion-dollar disasters\\n\\nThe U.S. was hit with a record 28 billion-dollar weather and climate disasters in 2023. These events resulted in an estimated 492 lives lost and over $93 billion in damages. The previous annual record, 22 disasters, was set in 2020.\\n\\nAmong 2023’s historic number of weather and climate disasters were:\\n\\nAn unprecedented number of severe storms and tornado outbreaks throughout the central U.S.\\n\\nA devastating fire outbreak in Maui, Hawai’i — the deadliest U.S. wildfire in at least a century.\\n\\nSouthern and Midwestern drought, resulting in extensive agricultural losses and disrupted commerce along the Mississippi River.\\n\\nHeavy flooding in California following a string of at least 12 atmospheric river storms.\\n\\nHurricane Idalia made landfall in Florida, fueled by record-shattering sea surface temperatures.\\n\\nHeavy rainfall and flooding events in Florida and the Northeast — with some areas reporting up to eight inches of rainfall within 24-hours.\\n\\nThe disasters of 2023 are part of a larger trend. Billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have become more frequent and more costly, bringing different risks to each U.S. region.\\n\\nDisaster seasons\\n\\nNOAA has tracked billion-dollar disasters since 1980, across seven event types: droughts, floods, freezes, severe storms, tropical cyclones, wildfires, and winter storms.\\n\\nNationwide, tropical cyclones are the most costly type of event. At nearly $1.4 trillion, tropical cyclones account for 52% of all billion-dollar disaster costs since 1980. Severe storms are the most frequent event type, accounting for half of all billion-dollar disasters since 1980.\\n\\nThe 44 years of data show that all states are affected by billion-dollar disasters, and that each U.S. region faces a different set of disaster risks each season. The varied climates, population density, and patterns of land development across the U.S. influence the characteristic mix of disasters in each region.\\n\\nThe U.S. tends to experience the most disasters from April through August.\\n\\nDuring the spring and summer, severe storms and river floods are generally most common — especially in the Upper Midwest, Ohio Valley, South, Southeast, Northeast.\\n\\nDuring the summer and into the fall, wildfires (in the West, Northwest, Southwest, and Northern Rockies and Plains) and tropical cyclones (in the South, Southeast, and Northeast) dominate.\\n\\nThe table below summarizes historical billion-dollar disaster data (1980-2023) for the entire U.S. and nine regions, showing the month with the highest frequency of disasters, as well as the two most frequent disaster types over the entire period of record.\\n\\nRegion Top Month Top Disaster (Frequency), 1980-2023 Second Disaster (Frequency), 1980-2023 United States June Severe Storm (50%) Tropical Cyclone (17%) Ohio Valley April, May Severe Storm (64%) Drought (12%) Upper Midwest May, June Severe Storm (68%) Drought (15%) Northeast April Severe Storm (55%) Winter Storm (16%) Northwest August Drought (42%) Wildfire (40%) South April Severe Storm (60%) Tropical Cyclone (12%) Southeast April Severe Storm (47%) Tropical Cyclone (24%) Southwest June Severe Storm (47%) Drought (23%) West October Wildfire (40%) Drought (32%) Northern Rockies and Plains June Severe Storm (53%) Drought (19%)\\n\\nCompound extreme events\\n\\nRegional disaster climatologies show that multiple disasters often overlap or occur back-to-back. For example, the Northwest often faces overlapping wildfires and droughts. In the Southeast, the risks of tropical cyclones rise in the summer just as spring severe storms are only starting to taper off.\\n\\nOverlapping or back-to-back extreme events are known as compound extreme events. We saw compound events in 2020 and 2021, when overlapping droughts and megafires devastated the western U.S. while the eastern U.S. faced back-to-back hurricanes. And in 2023, over a dozen southern and central states faced overlapping impacts from billion-dollar drought and severe storms.\\n\\nSuch compound disasters multiply the risks for communities and strain state and federal emergency response resources. And we can expect more of them in a warming climate, according to the Fifth National Climate Assessment: “Climate change is increasing the chances of multiple climate hazards occurring simultaneously or consecutively across the US and its territories.”\\n\\nThe rise in compound events is also reflected in the dramatic decrease in the time between billion-dollar events. Over the last five years (2019-2023), there were 16 days on average between U.S. billion-dollar disasters, compared to 82 days in the 1980s.\\n\\nIn 2023, the average time between billion-dollar disasters was just 12 days.\\n\\nHaving less time between disasters can mean less time and resources available for communities to respond, recover quickly, and prepare for future risks. Often, these risks aren’t equally shared.\\n\\nAccording to the Fifth National Climate Assessment: “Low-income communities, communities of color, and Tribes and Indigenous Peoples experience high exposure and vulnerability to extreme events due to both their proximity to hazard-prone areas and lack of adequate infrastructure or disaster management resources.”\\n\\nMore warming, more extremes, more people at risk\\n\\nAs the planet warms, many dangerous extreme events — from heat waves to wildfires and heavy rainfall and flooding — have become more frequent and/or intense around the globe.\\n\\nIn the U.S., billion-dollar weather and climate disasters have also become more frequent and costly.\\n\\nBillion-dollar disasters were 2.7 times more frequent over the last 20 years than during the previous 20 years.\\n\\nOver the same period, the average annual cost of these events has more than tripled from $28 billion per year (1984-2003) to $101 billion per year (2004-2023).\\n\\nThe rise in U.S. billion-dollar disasters reflects a mix of factors:\\n\\nFirst, as heat-trapping pollution continues to warm the planet, many types of extreme weather and climate hazards are becoming more frequent and/or more intense in the U.S. and across the globe.\\n\\nSecond, as the population has grown, so has the overall number of people, homes, and businesses at risk when extreme events occur.\\n\\nLastly, accelerated development in fire-prone areas, along coasts, and in floodplains can multiply the damage done by a given extreme event.\\n\\nHow does climate change affect key types of billion-dollar disaster events?\\n\\nDrought: Rising global temperatures are altering the water cycle and increasing the risk of drought in parts of the U.S.\\n\\nWarming air increases the potential evaporation from the land and transpiration from plants. This process increases the water available for precipitation in some areas but leads to drying in other areas.\\n\\nFor example, while most of the eastern U.S. has generally become wetter since 1900, the western U.S. — especially the Southwest — has experienced drier conditions.\\n\\nRisks of severe and prolonged megadroughts in the Southwest are projected to intensify over this century with continued warming. As the climate continues to warm, the western U.S. also faces increasing risks of hydrological drought due to declining snowpack and earlier spring melt.\\n\\nFlooding: Climate change is bringing heavier rainfall extremes and increased, inequitable flood risk to many parts of the U.S.\\n\\nFor every 1°F of warming the air can hold an extra 4% of moisture, increasing the chances of heavier downpours that contribute to the risk of flash floods.\\n\\nIn the U.S., extreme daily rainfall has become more frequent since the 1980s. Hourly rainfall intensity has also increased since 1970—by 13% on average across 150 U.S. locations analyzed by Climate Central.\\n\\nFrom 1958 to 2021, the heaviest 1% of rainfall events became 60% and 45% wetter in the Northeast and Midwest, respectively—and 17-37% wetter for all other regions except the Northwest.\\n\\nPrecipitation extremes are likely to increase globally, even in regions with decreasing average precipitation such as the U.S. Southwest, which is likely to face more intense flash floods with high future levels of heat-trapping emissions.\\n\\nSevere Storms: As our climate continues to warm, certain conditions favorable to thunderstorms and tornadoes are occurring more often and severe weather activity is expanding into historically less-active seasons and regions.\\n\\nSevere storms — thunderstorms that produce tornadoes, damaging wind, and/or hail — are localized events with limited historical records — making it difficult to directly link their occurrence to global climate change. Here’s some of what we do know:\\n\\nAlthough the number of tornadoes each year hasn’t changed since 1970 (when excluding the weakest events), tornado variability has increased — concentrated in fewer outbreaks of larger magnitude. And tornado frequency has shifted eastward since 1979, with increased tornadic activity observed in the South, Southeast, and Ohio Valley.\\n\\nSince 1979, parts of the eastern U.S. have seen up to 15 more days annually with high convective available potential energy during spring and summer—prime time for thunderstorms.\\n\\nStudies suggest that conditions favorable to severe thunderstorms will become about 5-20% more frequent per 1.8°F of warming. Whether these changing conditions will ultimately result in the formation of more severe storms remains an active area of research.\\n\\nTropical Cyclones: Warming oceans fuel stronger tropical cyclones that bring more heavy rainfall and higher storm surge when they make landfall.\\n\\nWarming of the surface ocean due to human-caused climate change is fueling an increased proportion of intense tropical cyclones and contributing to an increased fraction of storms that undergo rapid intensification.\\n\\nSince 1979, human-caused warming has increased the likelihood of a hurricane developing into a Category 3 or higher by about 8% per decade. The latest IPCC reports conclude that the proportion of very intense (Category 4 and 5) tropical cyclones is projected to increase globally with continued warming.\\n\\nAlthough the frequency of tropical storms is not necessarily increasing, sea level rise can amplify the storm surge potential when storms do occur, putting coastal residents at particular risk.\\n\\nHigher tropical cyclone rainfall rates are expected with further warming. Greater rainfall intensity can increase the risk of inland flooding, which accounts for more than half of past U.S. hurricane deaths.\\n\\nWildfire: More frequent hot, dry, windy conditions contribute to more wildfires that put people and ecosystems at risk.\\n\\nWildfires can be an ecologically important disturbance. But human-caused climate change, poor land management practices, and sprawling development have increased both the availability of fuel and the frequency of weather conditions that spark and spread dangerous fires.\\n\\nRegardless of how fires start, more frequent hot, dry, windy conditions affect fuel availability, fire behavior (ignition, duration, and spreading), and can compromise suppression efforts.\\n\\nAccording to Climate Central analysis spanning the contiguous U.S. over a 50-year period (1973-2022), wildfire seasons are lengthening and intensifying, especially in the western U.S.\\n\\nHuman-caused climate change accounts for at least two-thirds of the rapid increase in fire weather in the western U.S. in recent decades. And the latest IPCC reports project more frequent fire weather conditions with increased warming.\\n\\nLOCAL STORY ANGLES\\n\\nHow are Billion-Dollar Disasters impacting your state or county?\\n\\nNOAA’s Billion-Dollar Disasters data visualization tools offer insights:\\n\\nExplore the frequency and cost of billion-dollar weather and climate events in your state.\\n\\nUnderstand risk and vulnerability in your county or state by looking at weather and climate risk, socioeconomic vulnerability and future risk.\\n\\nBreakdown your state’s climatology and the historical disaster risks faced each season.\\n\\nCONTACT EXPERTS\\n\\nAdam B.

       "  \"What GAO Found\\n\\nThe Small Business Administration's (SBA) Disaster Loan Program is available to rural and urban communities to cover qualified losses after a declared disaster. Disaster loans are intended to help homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofits repair, rebuild, and recover from physical and economic losses. For fiscal years 2017–2022, applications for disaster loans from rural and urban areas were approved and declined at comparable rates. Across both types of areas, SBA approved about 40 percent and declined about 40 percent of applications that met minimum qualifications for acceptance. The remaining applications were withdrawn (18.5 percent) or were still being reviewed by SBA as of June 2023 (1.7 percent).\\n\\nOutcomes of SBA Disaster Loan Applications SBA Accepted by Geographic Area, Fiscal Years 2017–2022, as of June 2023\\n\\nNote: This analysis includes applications that met SBA’s minimum acceptance qualifications and excludes 20,882 applications that were duplicates or could not be classified as rural or urban.\\n\\nGAO found that rural communities may have characteristics that can make recovering from a disaster difficult. For instance, they are more likely to have limited telecommunication services (broadband and cellular) because of geographic barriers, such as mountains, or limited demand due to smaller and sparser populations. A lack of reliable communications can hamper outreach to disaster survivors and can make it harder for survivors to apply for disaster assistance. Also, rural communities often do not have the capacity and resources to support recovery activities. Stakeholders also identified challenges to obtaining assistance from SBA. For example, stakeholders noted that rural communities may not be aware of SBA disaster assistance and may not know that SBA aids homeowners as well as businesses.\\n\\nSBA has introduced new outreach approaches in recent years, such as portable outreach centers that can be established after a disaster in hard-to-reach areas, including rural communities. However, SBA's outreach policies and procedures do not distinguish between rural and urban communities, and SBA does not tailor its outreach to address the specific needs of rural communities. Developing outreach plans with specific methods to address challenges rural communities face after disasters could help improve their access to SBA's Disaster Loan Program.\\n\\nWhy GAO Did This Study\\n\\nGAO previously reported that the number and cost of weather and climate disasters, such as tornadoes and wildfires, are increasing in the United States. The Disaster Assistance for Rural Communities Act enabled the SBA Administrator to declare disasters in rural areas if certain conditions are met and included a provision for GAO to examine the unique challenges rural areas face when seeking disaster assistance from SBA. This report examines disaster loan trends in rural and urban areas for fiscal years 2017–2022, challenges rural communities may face after disasters, and SBA's actions that may address these challenges.\\n\\nGAO analyzed and geocoded SBA disaster loan application data for fiscal years 2017–2022 to show trends for approved, accepted, and declined loan applications for rural and urban areas. GAO also interviewed officials from SBA, four regional nonprofit organizations, and 18 state and local entities from three site visits. GAO further reviewed literature and key agency documents related to outreach, marketing, equity, and implementation of the new rural disaster declaration.\"],\n",

       "  'As a volunteer emergency responder, Eric Hodges was on his way to Tazewell County, after a devastating EF-4 tornado tore through the small town of Washington, lifting and dropping debris as far away as Chicago. But before he could get there, he had to turn around.\\n\\nThe tail end of the storm had impacted Normal, and all power was lost on Illinois State University’s campus. Hodges was Illinois State’s emergency manager, only three months into that role, and it was his job to coordinate the University’s response.\\n\\nBut without power, that was tough.\\n\\nOne light was still working in his building in the lobby of the University Police Department. That’s where he pulled the emergency management team together. Sitting on the floor, they worked for more than an hour to find a way to get a message out to the campus community.\\n\\n“That was the best we could come up with,” Hodges said. “It was rough. It was not a great way to be as effective as we could in coordinating our response.”\\n\\nThat was in 2013 and a year later, Illinois State’s dedicated Emergency Operations Center (EOC) opened. It’s a “hot” EOC, meaning it’s a space that requires no setup, which makes it unique among state university EOCs.\\n\\n“You turn on the lights and you are ready to go, and that’s a game changer,” Hodges said.\\n\\nHodges created an incident management team, a group of university leaders from across campus who are prepared to respond to everything from weather events and water main breaks to bomb threats, active shooters, and cyber security threats. The EOC also served as headquarters for the University’s COVID-19 pandemic response.\\n\\nAlthough the EOC may look like a typical conference room, it’s not. It has its own backup power, heating and cooling, five internet providers, rooftop radio antennas, and a communications suite to allow the team to coordinate with county and state public safety officials. A video wall can display feeds from 22 sources. If something happened to the building where the EOC is housed, the University has a reciprocal agreement with the Town of Normal to move to its emergency operations center.\\n\\n\\n\\n“Ten or 15 years ago if someone had an emergency, they would call 911. That is not the only avenue that people use anymore. If someone posts that they need help, that’s part of our responsibility.” Eric Hodges\\n\\nBut the EOC isn’t gathering dust waiting for the next power outage or storm. It’s also used to monitor planned events, from football games to concerts, commencement, and Homecoming. Every call for aid is tracked, from a health emergency to a fire from a tailgater’s grill.\\n\\nThe emergencies Hodges plans for are either likely or the consequences would be high.\\n\\n“One of them that is very low likelihood but very high consequences is an active shooter,” he said. “We have dedicated a lot of resources to training and preparedness, drills, exercises and outreach all related to that one threat.”\\n\\nHazardous materials is another one, not only because of Illinois State’s science labs, but because trains run close to campus. A 17-car derailment in 2021 directly across from Watterson Towers could have been much worse, he said. “If that had had hazardous materials on board and we had a full residence hall, that would have been a very different response.”\\n\\nCampus is also susceptible to flash flooding, which happened a few years ago when a storm dumped 11 inches of rain, and buildings were inundated. But the most common emergency is winter weather, and the team has had plenty of practice with that one.\\n\\nTwo to three days before a storm, the incident management team gathers for weather briefings and reviews events scheduled on campus. As the system gets closer, they discuss the possibility of closure, late start, or early dismissal. At about 3 a.m. on the day of the storm, there’s a call with the National Weather Service and local government, school, and business leaders. Decisions on late starts or closure are to be made by 5:30 a.m.\\n\\nBut sometimes, the unexpected happens, like the day a few years ago freezing rain didn’t show up on radar but coated the campus in a thin sheet of ice at 7 a.m. Within 10 minutes, the decision was made for a late start. “That was about the worst-case scenario,” Hodges said. “It wasn’t forecasted. It just happened, and we had to react.”\\n\\nOver the last decade, one of the big changes he’s seen in emergency management is the role of social media. The EOC has a social media analytics and response team that monitors social media and posts messages but also looks for posts from those who might need help.\\n\\n“Ten or 15 years ago if someone had an emergency, they would call 911,” Hodges said. “That is not the only avenue that people use anymore. If someone posts that they need help, that’s part of our responsibility.”\\n\\nHodges didn’t start out at Illinois State in emergency operations. For 18 years, he was in information technology, but he’s been involved in preparing for emergencies for more than three decades. For 25 years, he was a volunteer with the McLean County Emergency Management Agency, and he also serves on the statewide Illinois Incident Management Team.\\n\\nIllinois State’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is a “hot” EOC, meaning it’s a space that requires no setup. “You turn on the lights and you are ready to go, and that’s a game changer,” Emergency Manager Eric Hodges said.\\n\\nHis experience goes beyond campus. He has responded to state and national emergencies, including Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and Superstorm Sandy in the mid-Atlantic region in 2012.\\n\\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit in 2020, he was tapped by the Illinois Emergency Management agency to be bureau chief of operations. That took him away from Illinois State for six months, but he returned in February 2021.\\n\\n“I was drawn to help on a larger scale, and it was hard to say no to that request,” he said.\\n\\nIn his field, he’s seeing a change in the emergencies he has to prepare for.\\n\\n“In addition to all the natural hazards and human-caused disasters, some of the big areas of interest for our profession are the impacts of weather and climate, cyber incidents, and pandemics,” he said. “One of the greatest threats any organization faces is a cybersecurity incident. We spend a lot\\n\\nof time preparing for and exercising that particular hazard.”\\n\\nIt was in college that Hodges first became hooked on emergency management. He overheard students in his residence hall listening to fire calls on a radio scanner, and that was it.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture administers several programs to mitigate the economic costs of drought. One of these programs is the Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), which provides payments to livestock producers impacted by drought. Program evaluation results suggest that producers in drought affected counties that received LFP payments achieved similar herd retention and liquidation outcomes as producers in less drought impacted counties that were ineligible for LFP payments. Modeling results suggest that LFP poses a financial-climate risk to the Federal budget.

       "  'Texas A&M University students sorted through the chaos of tropical storm-induced floodwaters, an earthquake and a shooting on Friday in a simulated disaster designed to prepare future health care professionals for large-scale emergencies.\\n\\nThe student-led exercise, held at Texas A&M Engineering Extension Service’s (TEEX) Disaster City in College Station, tested students in a variety of areas, including triage, patient care, mental health support and disaster management.\\n\\nStarted by the Texas A&M School of Nursing in 2008, the training has grown from a small event in the gym of a local church to a daylong disaster simulation involving more than 700 students, over 100 faculty and staff members, and numerous emergency response professionals. Students from Texas A&M schools of dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy and public health, as well as athletic training, psychology and veterinary medicine students and the Corps of Cadets, participated in the drill.\\n\\nChristine Kaunas, assistant vice president for Interprofessional Practice, Education & Research (IPER) at Texas A&M Health Science Center, said the annual Disaster Day exercise is an important component of preparing students to work together in emergency situations.\\n\\n“Since 2020 alone, Texas has seen over 15 disasters and related declarations, including wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, winter storms, and of course COVID-19. Ensuring that our health professions students are prepared to respond effectively when, not if, a disaster strikes is crucial,” Kaunas said.\\n\\nMore than 50 students from Texas A&M Health work to plan and organize the event, with oversight from faculty and staff members as well as staff from TEEX, the Texas Division of Emergency Management and participating partners.\\n\\nEach year, a new scenario is selected and kept secret until the day of the event to provide the realism of an unexpected situation. This year’s simulated disaster included a tropical storm, flooding, an earthquake and an active shooter. The students engaged in triage at the disaster site, patient care at mock field hospitals, mental health care and needs assessment at an evacuation shelter and family reunification center, and disaster management and simulation oversight at Disaster City’s Emergency Operations Training Center.\\n\\nDuring the simulation, students take on the role of patients or providers or engage in search and rescue. Students who participate as patients receive makeup, known as moulage, to mimic injuries based on the scenario. Patients act out the case they are assigned, while students in roles of physicians and nurses do field assessments then transfer patients to a field hospital for more diagnosis and treatment. Pharmacy students work with providers to determine the medications needed, and psychology students provide the mental health care required of disaster victims. Athletic training and dentistry students provide specialized care in orthopedic and soft tissue trauma, and head and neck injuries, respectively. Public health students manage the disaster to deploy resources and address outbreaks. The veterinary students provide care for animals affected by the disaster.\\n\\nDr. Angela Clendenin, a Texas A&M Health instructional associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics, said the exercise is effective because it has all the components of a real emergency, with different people coming together to solve the problem.\\n\\n“It shows them exactly the things that can happen in a community and it gives them the soft skills of communication across disciplines, teamwork, leadership, collaboration, but at the same time, I think it gives them confidence so that if something were to happen in a community where they end up practicing, they can have that muscle memory,” she said.\\n\\nAllyson Rioux, a first-year nursing student, acted out the role of someone with an injury and said she was interested in seeing how the other students would diagnose and treat her injuries.\\n\\n“This is exactly what you learn in nursing school, how to assess symptoms and then make a treatment plan based on what they’re presenting with,” she said.\\n\\nOther students said the exercise helped connect their classroom experience with the real-life challenges of the profession.\\n\\n“It’s really interesting to see what I’ve learned in my emergency management class play out. It is the first hands-on experience that I have really gotten,” said Olivia Bomba ’26, a public health major.\\n\\n“Disaster Day serves as an amazing learning opportunity for students by striking a balance between the chaos of an emergency and providing the structure and support necessary for successful and meaningful learning,” said Lyssa Losa, a graduate student in environmental health at the School of Public Health and planning director for Disaster Day.\\n\\nAs the event has grown, so has the collaboration with corporations and government agencies, including H-E-B, Salvation Army, St. Joseph Health, Pulsara and the Texas Department of Emergency Management. Members of the university community, private and public partners, and representatives from local, state and federal agencies toured this year’s event to learn about Texas A&M Health’s efforts to address disaster response.\\n\\n“Disaster Day stands as a testament to Texas A&M Health’s proactive commitment in shaping agile and resilient Aggie health professionals,” said Indra Reddy, chief operating officer and vice president at Texas A&M Health. “With the escalating frequency of large-scale emergencies, we take pride in the assurance that Aggie health professionals are well prepared and ready to respond.”'],\n",

Category 5 hurricanes like Maria can throw wind speeds 157 mph and higher, ripping shingles off roofs and tossing cars through the air. Maria dumped 20 inches of rain in only a few hours, damaging more than 300,000 homes.\\n\\nAfter hurricanes subside, government and nonprofit disaster-relief organizations kick into high gear, bringing food and fresh water and providing safe shelter to residents impacted by the storm.\\n\\nYet years later, despite those efforts residents still feel the impact of disasters.\\n\\nSince graduating with a degree in environmental science, Yiyuan Qin has focused on community-driven approaches to solving climate change.\\n\\nYiyuan “Jasmine” Qin ’12 cofounded tech startup re+connect to close the gap between well-meaning government and nonprofit aid and the needs of individuals in places like Puerto Rico. She and her team recently received a $1-million grant from the National Science Foundation to test their community-based software.\\n\\n“Re+connect is a participatory civic tech initiative with the goal to crowdsource up-to-date information on who needs what and where on the ground so governments and foundations can better reach and distribute disaster relief,” Qin said.\\n\\nThe app is still in its early phases. Winning the NSF grant competition is the first step toward making re+connect a reality on the ground. The team—made up of an interdisciplinary consortium of universities, nonprofits, and technology experts—has a year to complete a pilot project that tests their technology on the island. “This year is all about finding a viable path forward, so this can be a sustainable, scalable, and transferable solution,” she said.\\n\\n“The truth is, when communities are better connected to one another, they’re more likely to survive.” Yiyuan ‘Jasmine’ Qin ’12\\n\\nSince graduating with a degree in environmental science from Colby, Qin has focused on community-driven approaches to solving climate change. That includes spending a year studying river communities along the Rhine, Amazon, Mekong, Ganges, and Murray-Darling rivers through a Watson Fellowship and completing not one but two master’s degrees—the first in environmental management from Yale University, and the second an integrated design and management degree from MIT.\\n\\n“I’ve always seen the power and the innovation capacity and what communities can do,” Qin said. “I just felt this challenge of building things from the top down without truly understanding and bringing in communities as a stakeholder as we build solutions to environmental issues.”\\n\\nHer research at MIT led her to start re+connect. Said Qin, “The first time I went to Puerto Rico, I really saw the impact of climate change on people that I hadn’t seen before, and it was soul-crushing. When disasters happen, it’s very difficult for any relief entities to actually get into communities to help.”\\n\\nStepping into a leadership role was the culmination of an interdisciplinary, community-based approach toward environmental science for the Colby graduate.\\n\\nEven with minor hurricanes, recovery can take time. But after Hurricane Maria, some parts of Puerto Rico lost power for almost an entire year—a blackout blocking the rebuilding of roads, hospitals, schools, and water systems. By 2022, though FEMA allocated $28 billion to help the island recover, officials had only used $5.3 billion, or about 19 percent. Rebuilding has gone slowly, leaving the island in a vulnerable spot for the next hurricane season.\\n\\nThat’s what re+connect hopes to change.\\n\\n“The truth is, when communities are better connected to one another, they’re more likely to survive,” said Qin. “Our hope is that through crowdsourcing community information and processing that data, we can build social infrastructure and connect communities with organizations and resources. I want to give people a sense of agency so they can continue to call Puerto Rico home.”\\n\\nFor Qin, stepping into a leadership role is the culmination of years of taking an interdisciplinary, community-based approach toward environmental science—something she learned from her adviser, Philip Nyhus, the Elizabeth and Lee Ainslie Professor of Environmental Studies. “Having Philip as my adviser was probably the luckiest thing ever for my professional career,” she said. “It wasn’t just teaching me the specifics of my field, but as an immigrant, coming here by myself, having a mentor like that built so much of my confidence to just go for it.”\\n\\nThis kind of confidence meant dabbling in a wide variety of classes and extracurriculars at Colby and as a graduate student. “I think the ability to try different things gives you so much confidence, and the opportunities at Colby started it all,” she said. “After all, entrepreneurship is the idea of tinkering with something that no one has done before.”\\n\\nNow, she’s taking everything she’s learned and trying something new.\\n\\nSaid Qin, “It’s a whole new challenge for me to bring this technology to life, and I’m so excited to make a difference.”'],\n",

       "  'It was when the icy waters began to reach about 5 feet high that Roger Bintliff realized he needed to flee.\\n\\nThe veteran restaurateur, who runs a cafe in Gardiner, Maine, had brought a water pump down to the basement in an attempt to mitigate the damage. But floodwaters from a raging December storm were now rushing down the steps at an alarming rate.\\n\\n“That water came so fast. It went from about 18 inches to 5 feet within two hours,” Bintliff told the Maine Monitor. “My refrigerators started floating and tipping over, blocking my doorways. I had to swim underneath them to get out and I had to abandon the pump.”\\n\\nThe flooding ultimately caused Bintliff $100,000 in damages, wrecking his fridges, water heater and other equipment. He then discovered his insurance policy didn’t cover flood damages. And like other small business owners in his neighborhood, he had already sunk his whole life into the venture.\\n\\nBut Bintliff and others in his situation could soon find it easier to access federal aid for such disasters.\\n\\nOn Monday, the Biden administration published an interim rule that overhauls a major federal disaster aid program, which has become increasingly important as climate change fuels more destructive hurricanes, wildfires and other extreme weather events across the United States. The changes could be most beneficial to environmental justice communities, which are often the most vulnerable to natural disasters but lack the resources to properly recover from them.\\n\\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said the changes would streamline the application process for its Individual Assistance program, which provides financial assistance for survivors of natural disasters. The agency also said the move would increase the number of people eligible for disaster aid under the program, which now includes tens of thousands of additional federal dollars per household.\\n\\n“The fact that Mother Nature is not letting up, the fact that we are breaking records year after year as disasters become deadly, more frequent and more severe—we need to be better prepared to recover from natural disasters faster and more effectively,” FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told reporters last week ahead of the agency’s move to finalize the rule Monday.\\n\\nThe new rule goes into effect March 22. Its changes include the removal of an insurance cap that disqualified property owners of aid and wider access to a one-time $750 payment meant to help survivors with immediate needs, like food, rent and evacuation costs. That payment would be in addition to aid for home repairs and other disaster-related needs.\\n\\nThe rule also removes a previous requirement that forced some applicants to first apply for a low-interest disaster loan from the Small Business Administration. Only after being rejected by that loan program could applicants qualify for FEMA aid.\\n\\nFEMA provides roughly $2 billion in federal disaster aid to more than 1 million Americans every year. But the agency’s assistance programs have come under increasing scrutiny in recent years for their complicated application processes, which have often resulted in a large number of applicants getting rejected and low payouts for those who managed to qualify.\\n\\nAccording to reporting from E&E News, FEMA’s Individual Assistance program has rejected 46 percent of its applications since 2002, while doling out an average of just $3,431 to those who did qualify for aid—an amount that is often too little to cover the numerous costs disaster survivors face, including making home repairs.\\n\\nThe data also showed that a disproportionate number of the rejected applicants were also likely struggling to make ends meet, with 62 percent of the people who sought disaster aid coming from “lower income” households.\\n\\nFEMA’s aid programs have also been found to explicitly exclude Black Americans. In an attempt to reduce fraud, FEMA had long required applicants for disaster aid to provide a deed or other formal proof of homeownership. The policy prevented thousands of Black families in southern states from getting help after natural disasters, reporting by The Washington Post found, because more than a third of Black-owned land in the South is passed down informally—a practice that was largely established as a result of Jim Crow era discriminatory practices. The agency scrapped that requirement in 2021 amid public outcry.\\n\\nMonday’s interim rule, which is part of the Biden administration’s larger efforts to address the nation’s historic inequalities, could be a big deal for vulnerable communities. By making federal disaster aid more accessible to everyone, it’s people of color and poor communities that stand to gain the most. Black Americans and low-income families are more likely to live in flood zones and have fewer resources to recover from property damage caused by extreme weather, according to recent reports and studies.\\n\\nLast fall, the Biden administration released the latest National Climate Assessment, which found that census tracts with more than 20 percent Black residents will likely see a more than 40 percent increase in annual financial losses from floods by 2050, compared to the national average of about 26 percent. And a 2020 study, published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters, found that the number of affordable housing units exposed to extreme coastal flooding in the United States is projected to more than triple by 2050.\\n\\nMore Top Climate News\\n\\nExxon Sues ESG Investors to Stop Climate Proposals on Ballot: ExxonMobil filed a lawsuit to prevent activist investors from bringing climate proposals to its annual shareholders meetings, calling the effort an “extreme agenda,” Kevin Crowley reports for Bloomberg. The investors’ proposal seeks to set ambitious targets to slash the oil giant’s carbon emissions, including those emitted by its customers. Exxon’s decision to seek legal judgment rather than go through the Securities and Exchange Commission is highly unusual and marks an aggressive pushback against activist investors.\\n\\nJoe Manchin Mulls a Third Party Presidential Run: Sen.

Federal government and private sector leaders, including representatives from FEMA and SAMHSA, will join Governors to discuss modernizing critical infrastructure models to optimize capacity to navigate long-term recovery efforts. The Task Force’s meeting will also focus on state best practices for survivor resilience, data sharing and staff preparedness.\\n\\nGovernors Green and Scott recently shared more insights into the work the Public Health and Disaster Response Task Force is leading, including details about the upcoming session.\\n\\nHow has your state or territory dealt with disasters?\\n\\nGovernor Green: Last August, hurricane-force winds fanned fires on the islands of Maui and Hawaiʻi causing the deadliest wildfire in modern U.S. history. To alleviate the conditions of this emergency, state and local officials swiftly coordinated to execute our State Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan which included: the State Emergency Operations Center activating Emergency Support Functions to continue disseminating public information, mobilizing resources, and coordinating with partner states for mutual aid assistance; the Hawaiʻi Department of Transportation and public works crews readying debris-clearing equipment as well as road signs and barricades; mobilizing the Hawaiʻi National Guard to assist in citizen evacuation, rescue missions, traffic control, security, and debris clearance; and the Department of Education, Department of Health, American Red Cross and other Voluntary Organizations Active in Disasters members coordinated efforts to open shelters from August 8, 2023, onwards, supporting local operations as needed. My administration proactively addressed the wildfires by promptly seeking federal assistance to safeguard our most vulnerable communities, regions, and resources. This proactive measure was essential to support and facilitate the implementation of my administration’s approach. I’ve worked closely with President Biden and his administration to secure FEMA Stafford Act funding for debris removal and emergency protective measures. This crucial support is expected to save Hawaiʻi hundreds of millions of dollars during the recovery process, allowing us to sustain immediate assistance to families in need. In addition to the immense federal, state, and county assistance received, we saw an outpouring of support from concerned citizens, community groups, and private-sector partners who graciously volunteered at the disaster site, offered up their homes, or organized donations drives where tens of millions of dollars poured into the relief efforts from all over the world. Working with these partners in the two weeks after August 8, we relocated more than 8,000 displaced survivors into hotel rooms and condos across Maui. My administration is deeply committed to securing long-term housing for each Lahaina fire survivor and will cover the fair market value of each rental for up two years and provide a property tax exemption for 18 months to those dedicating their short-term rentals to housing displaced fire victims. The enduring strength of our people is a constant inspiration as we embark on this collective journey of healing. Lahaina belongs to its people, and we are committed to rebuilding and restoring it the way they want it.\\n\\nGovernor Scott: Last July, Vermont faced significant flooding causing severe damage to communities, homes and businesses. I’m proud of the way my team responded, taking action early by pre-placing resources, including swift water rescue teams ahead of the storm’s arrival, and then working quickly with federal and local partners to address the needs of towns, emergency responders, and road crews. This work included proactive response – going out and looking for homeowners and municipalities in need of assistance rather than always waiting for them to come to us. Our immediate response may be over, but there is still a long road ahead for us to recover and build back stronger and more resilient. Climate change is happening before our eyes, and we will continue to see more weather-related disasters as a result. We must focus on better preparing our communities. Planning is key. This summer also reminded me that we rely heavily on volunteers to do essential work in response and recovery, from small things like checking on neighbors to taking on larger projects like mucking out basements, gathering debris, or cleaning up the neighborhood park. I’m grateful for everything Vermonters have done and continue to do to help their neighbors and communities.\\n\\nHow is your state or territory increasing critical infrastructure needs for emergency preparedness and recovery?\\n\\nGovernor Green: Since the wildfire devastation on August 8, 2023, our state has taken significant measures to reinforce our critical infrastructure for emergency preparedness and recovery. My administration has set aside up to $600 million in the budget for recovery costs that will continue into 2027. We have prioritized strengthening communication networks, improving early warning systems, fortifying evacuation routes, and ensuring that first responders have the necessary resources and training to prevent, mitigate, and address future emergencies. At the Hawaiʻi Emergency Management Agency (HI-EMA), we’ve created 20 positions to work on firebreaks, fire assessments, and wildfire matters. HI-EMA is in process of administering the Hazard Mitigation, Grant Program from the August 2023 Fires. These funds – estimated at over $150 million will allow partners in the state to reduce and mitigate hazard vulnerability to people, property, infrastructure, and the environment. In collaborating directly with President Biden and his administration, the Department of Energy has provided $95 million through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to harden Hawaiʻi’s electric grid, improve service, limit damage during future events, and prevent failures in the future that could lead to severe events. The wildfires magnified the consequences of climate change, which contributed to causing the worst natural disaster in our state’s history. This legislative session, I am renewing my efforts to pass a climate impact fee to help us stare down the terrible impacts of climate change. A $25 Climate Impact Fee on visitors would provide the needed resources to protect our environment, increase awareness of the impacts of climate change, and would be invested into beach preservation, fire breaks, and other prevention measures to help us avoid tragedies like the one last year on Maui. The collaborative reconstruction of Lahaina will inform our vision for Hawaiʻi as a resilient state.\\n\\nGovernor Scott: Since our last devastating storm (Tropical Storm Irene) in 2011, Vermont has invested heavily in resiliency work, like expanding storm and wastewater capacity, buy outs, floodplain restoration, hardening infrastructure, expanding mitigation tools, and more. These efforts are focused on revitalizing our communities and minimizing the damage resulting from natural disasters. Additionally, we are seeing increased cybersecurity threats, and I’m concerned that we will see more incidents that severely impact state operations or disrupt critical resources. To better prepare, we’ve created a Cybersecurity Advisory Council to help us better understand the preparedness of critical utilities and health care facilities, share information, and share best practices.\\n\\nCan you please share how you think the NGA Winter Meeting helps further bipartisan policy solutions for public health and disaster preparedness?\\n\\nGovernor Green: The NGA Winter Meeting serves as a crucial platform for fostering bipartisan policy solutions, particularly in the context of public health and disaster preparedness, such as the Maui fires on August 8, 2023. By convening governors from across the nation, the NGA facilitates the exchange of insights, best practices, and collaborative strategies. The lessons learned from the Maui fires incident response, coordination, and recovery can be shared, allowing for the development of more effective and bipartisan policies that enhance public health and disaster preparedness efforts. This meeting provides an invaluable opportunity for governors to collectively address challenges, share expertise, and work towards comprehensive solutions that benefit all states.\\n\\nGovernor Scott: All Governors deal with similar challenges, regardless of their political party. NGA meetings are a great opportunity for us to talk about the issues we all face. During the pandemic, these connections were essential to helping states get necessary supplies and collaborate on solutions for managing public health needs. With many governors on the Public Health and Disaster Response Task Force having dealt with a variety of emergencies like flooding, fires and hurricanes, this year’s meeting will be another opportunity to learn from each other on issues critical to the safety of the people we serve.'],\n",

       " ['Natural Disaster Risk: State Fiscal Debates to Watch in 2024',\n",
       "  None,\n",
       "  \"This article is the fifth and final in a series about public finance issues that are likely to capture the attention of lawmakers this year.\\n\\nIn 2023, U.S. states endured more weather-related disasters causing a billion dollars or more in damage than ever. The increasing cost and risk of natural disasters is playing a major role in shrinking the home insurance market and driving up rates in Gulf Coast and Western states. In response, leaders in these states have taken a range of steps to protect property and state budgets from the myriad threats posed by more frequent and costly disasters.\\n\\nIn Florida, a rapid loss of insurers and rising cost of policies has prompted regulatory changes designed to reduce the state’s budget exposure as the de facto home insurer, and Governor Ron DeSantis (R) proposed a fiscal 2025 budget that includes more than $500 million to cut taxes and other insurance costs for homeowners. Similarly, in California, where seven of the largest 12 insurance groups paused or restricted new business last year, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara announced a major overhaul of regulations. The new regime will relax restrictions on rate increases—almost certainly prompting widespread hikes for homeowners—while also mandating broader coverage in high-risk areas. And in Louisiana, newly elected Commissioner of Insurance Tim Temple wants to make the state’s regulatory climate more friendly to insurers and reduce litigation. Like Florida, the Pelican State is rolling out an incentive program to encourage private companies to assume homeowner policies currently in the state-backed insurance program.\\n\\nLocal entities funded in part by states are also feeling the insurance squeeze. School districts throughout Louisiana, for example, are seeing dramatic cuts in coverage amid increasing costs. Ascension Parish, outside of Baton Rouge, now pays twice as much as it did five years ago for half as much property insurance coverage. Public housing authorities are also grappling with rising rates.\\n\\nAdditionally, states are dealing with increased volatility in their own spending on natural disaster response and recovery as the damage caused by extreme weather events becomes more costly. Although 46 states have a disaster spending account, most don't have a consistent strategy for funding it.\\n\\nRecent years, however, have seen more policymakers pay attention to disaster funding practices in the interest of mitigating states’ fiscal risk. In Massachusetts, one of the four states without such an account, lawmakers are proposing a new disaster relief fund. As noted in previous research from The Pew Charitable Trusts, California has authorized utility companies to issue bonds backed by ratepayer revenue to support disaster preparedness and recovery for critical infrastructure, and Nevada recently granted its forestry department access to a contingency fund that provides additional dollars for wildfire response.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in the face of growing need and in response to federal policymakers' concerns about the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s fiscal exposure, states continue to increase their focus on funding mitigation, response, and recovery. For example, South Carolina last year completed its first statewide resilience plan and supported it with $200 million in funding for implementation. California recently appropriated $2.7 billion over four years for wildfire resilience, and Louisiana officials have a $1.7 billion list of coastal restoration and hurricane risk reduction projects they hope to prioritize in the next fiscal year.\\n\\nLiz Farmer works on The Pew Charitable Trusts’ state fiscal policy project.\"],\n",

Doug Burgum has requested a presidential major disaster declaration for a severe winter ice storm that caused more than $11.5 million in estimated damage over the Christmas holiday. The request follows an executive order Burgum issued Dec. 29 declaring a statewide emergency for infrastructure damage.\\n\\nIn a letter directed to President Joe Biden through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Burgum requested a major disaster be declared for the period of Dec. 25-27 for 13 counties: Barnes, Cass, Dickey, Grant, LaMoure, Logan, McIntosh, Ransom, Richland, Sargent, Steele, Stutsman and Traill. The counties of Burleigh, Grand Forks, Griggs, Kidder and Wells were also impacted by the event but didn’t sustain enough damage to exceed the per-capita threshold for being included in the declaration request.\\n\\nFreezing rain and winds in excess of 40 mph combined to destroy more than 2,000 power poles and forced the closure of major highways and other roads due to life-threatening conditions.\\n\\n“This was the worst ice storm since 1997 for much of eastern North Dakota, bringing the region to a standstill over the Christmas holiday, causing enormous damage to utility infrastructure and knocking out power to more than 20,000 residents, including some who went without electricity for more than 10 days,” Burgum said. “We appreciate the consideration of this major disaster request and are grateful for the utility crews and linemen from across the region who helped to restore power, as well as for the state and local emergency management teams, road crews, first responders, health care workers and others who worked together to ensure the safety of all North Dakotans during this historic event.”\\n\\nIf granted, a presidential declaration would unlock FEMA public assistance to help pay for the costs of repairing damaged infrastructure.\\n\\nIn addition, Burgum also is asking that the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program be implemented on a statewide basis to help communities pay for projects that increase resiliency and reduce costs in the long run.'],\n",

       "  \"Emergency Preparedness: What Do People with HIV Need to Know?\\n\\nAll Americans should have a plan for what to do during a hurricane, wildfire, or other emergency. But for people with HIV, it’s especially important to be prepared.\\n\\nPlan ahead. To stay healthy, people with HIV must take HIV medicine (called antiretroviral therapy or ART) exactly as prescribed and get and keep an undetectable viral load—a level of HIV in your blood so low that a standard lab test can’t detect it. A natural disaster or other emergency may make it harder for you to do this. To avoid interruptions in your HIV treatment, ask your health care provider if you can get a 30-day (or longer) emergency prescription refill of your HIV medicine. Some states permit coverage for advanced refills of prescription medicine during an emergency, but laws vary by state. Learn more about Emergency Prescription Laws in your state.\\n\\nMake a list of medicines and gather other medical paperwork. Keep a list of your HIV medicines and any others you take, their dosage amounts, and frequency, and a summary of your HIV treatment history in case you have to see another provider temporarily. Make sure you have a copy of your insurance card and the phone numbers for your providers and pharmacies.\\n\\nCommunicate with your provider. Talk to your healthcare provider about what you should do if you run out of medicine due to an emergency. In addition, in the event of an outbreak of a disease (like the flu), ask your provider whether you need to take specific precautions because you have HIV. See information about COVID-19 below.\\n\\nFollow safety guidelines. Be aware that some types of disasters may affect air and water quality—which can be even harder on people with HIV and others with weakened immune systems. If you have HIV, disruptions in the availability of food and clean water can increase your risk for opportunistic infections. If proper sanitation and hygiene are an issue, it’s important to follow proper food and water safety guidelines. See CDC’s information on keeping food and water safe after a disaster or emergency. Also follow local guidance about exercise and going outside on days with poor air quality. See CDC’s information on protecting yourself during wildfire season.\\n\\nWash your hands. Regular handwashing with soap and clean water is the best way to remove germs that can make you and others sick. If you don’t have soap and clean water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\\n\\nStay up to date on your vaccines. Make sure your vaccines for infections and illnesses such as tetanus and seasonal flu are up to date. Know the date of your last tetanus shot in case of injury in an emergency. (Learn more about COVID-19 vaccines, below.)\\n\\nLearn how you can get emergency prescription assistance. The Department of Health and Human Service’s Emergency Prescription Assistance Program may be activated after a disaster. It is a free service that helps people in a federally-identified disaster who do not have health insurance get the prescription drugs, vaccinations, medical supplies, and equipment that they need. Visit PHE.gov/EPAP for details.\\n\\nCOVID-19 and Emergency Preparedness\\n\\nDuring emergencies, people with chronic health conditions can face special health challenges, particularly if local COVID-19 hospital admissions levels are high. Here are some actions you can take to stay healthy:\\n\\nGet vaccinated for COVID-19. CDC recommends everyone—including people with HIV—stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccines for their age group. According to CDC, here’s what you need to know:\\n\\n* People aged 12 years and older who have not previously gotten any COVID-19 vaccine doses and choose to get Novavax should get 2 doses of updated Novavax vaccine to be up to date.\\n\\nLearn more about CDC's vaccine recommendations.\\n\\nIf you have questions about getting COVID-19 vaccine and whether it is right for you, talk to your health care provider.\\n\\nVisit vaccines.gov or call 1-800-232-0233 to find a COVID-19 vaccine near you.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnderstand your COVID-19 risk, and the risks that might affect others so that you can make decisions to protect yourself and others.\\n\\nFollow CDC’s recommended COVID-19 preventive actions.\\n\\nResources to Help You Plan Ahead\\n\\nThere are many resources to help you prepare for emergencies and disasters:\\n\\nHelp with Recovery\\n\\nDuring and after a disaster, it is natural to experience different and strong emotions. Coping with these feelings and getting help when you need it will help you, your family, and your community recover from a disaster.\\n\\nThe Disaster Distress Helpline supports people who need crisis counseling after experiencing a traumatic event or disaster. Counselors are trained to offer immediate support to people who may be experiencing a range of symptoms. Call or text 1-800-985-5990.

       "  'February 27, 2024\\n\\nWASHINGTON, D.C. — Maine’s Congressional Delegation wrote to President Joe Biden in support of Governor Janet Mills’ request for a Major Disaster Declaration to help address the estimated $70.3 million in damage that occurred across eight Maine counties during the January 10 and January 13 storms. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Angus King, and Representatives Chellie Pingree and Jared Golden asked the President to fully grant the Governor’s request to make federal assistance available for Cumberland, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Waldo, Washington, and York counties.\\n\\n“The back-to-back coastal storms that entered Maine on January 10 and January 13, 2024, brought wind gusts of more than 60 to 80 miles per hour and heavy rainfall. The storms caused widespread historic coastal flooding, and historic damages to public and private infrastructure across the State’s coastline and islands. Because these were the second and third severe storms in less than a month, we anticipate a lengthy recovery effort,” the Delegation wrote.\\n\\n“We urge you to expeditiously approve Governor Mills’ request for Major Disaster Declarations for the counties in question. Handling this expeditiously is especially warranted as many of these areas have been affected by other disasters, some natural, some economic, all of which have made this a particularly difficult year for the region. The people of Maine are in great need of this federal assistance, and we thank you for your support,” continued the Delegation.\\n\\nPreviously, the Delegation wrote a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) backing Governor Mills’ request that the January 10 and 13 storms be treated as a single disaster event to streamline federal response. The Maine Delegation also wrote a letter to the President in support of Governor Mills’ request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the December storm damage.\\n\\nRead the full letter here or below.\\n\\n+++\\n\\nDear Mr. President:\\n\\nWe write in full support of Maine Governor Janet Mills’ request for a Major Disaster Declaration for eight of Maine’s sixteen counties: Cumberland, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, Waldo, Washington, and York.\\n\\nAs demonstrated in the Governor’s request, it is clear these counties experienced substantial damages that collectively exceed the State’s capabilities. The back-to-back coastal storms that entered Maine on January 10 and January 13, 2024, brought wind gusts of more than 60 to 80 miles per hour and heavy rainfall. The storms caused widespread historic coastal flooding, and historic damages to public and private infrastructure across the State’s coastline and islands. Because these were the second and third severe storms in less than a month, we anticipate a lengthy recovery effort.\\n\\nDue to the geographical proximity and interconnected impact of the storms, the Maine State government, supported by an analysis from the National Weather Service, assessed the damages as one event. We wrote to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) last month requesting that it also consider treating the back-to-back storms as a single event.\\n\\nAs you know, Maine currently has nine open Disaster Declarations for 2023, with a tenth requested in December and declared on January 31, 2024. Towns throughout the State are struggling with astronomical mitigation and infrastructure repair costs, with the added devastation from these two storms.\\n\\nAccording to media reports, the January 10 storm’s impact was similar to a hurricane, altering many sections of the coast by lowering beaches, damaging sea walls, and eroding dunes by up to 15 feet in certain areas. Coastal flooding was worsened in some places by rain and melting snow, in addition to the high tides, and winds were so strong that they pushed a 737-commercial aircraft into a jet bridge at the Portland International Jetport. Similarly, as shown in media reports covering the storm on January 13, the devastating impact exacerbated the existing damages from a few days prior—destroying seawalls, leaving homes ready to collapse into the ocean, submerging vehicles, grounding fishing vessels, washing away fishing shacks, creating municipal water supply issues, floating oil tanks from unidentified sources, and causing hundreds of road closures.\\n\\nCoastal communities statewide reported unprecedented damage to critical infrastructure, including roads, piers, wharfs, bridges, causeways, and docks. The destruction is catastrophic for commercial fishermen who depend upon this infrastructure for their livelihoods, and in some cases, island residents were cut off from the mainland because causeways were submerged. Local news coverage on both storms also included reports and photographs of homes washed away and floating in the flood waters, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) preliminary data suggests that the storm created record high water levels at a Bar Harbor monitoring site. It is our understanding that the Cumberland County City of Portland and the Washington County Town of Cutler also experienced near record high water levels. In Penobscot County, power outages and flooding closed a number of downtown Bangor businesses. The magnitude of the damages is immeasurable and will be felt for many years to come.\\n\\nDue to extensive damage across the stated region, the Governor requested Public Assistance (PA) categories A through G, and Z, as well as Individual Assistance, and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) funding for use statewide. The State has verified that all of the damaged infrastructure included in the validation process is not eligible for commercially available insurance coverage, placing all repair costs on local government taxpayers if federal assistance is not obtained. Due to the extent of infrastructure damages, State resources are not adequate to meet local recovery needs.\\n\\nWe urge you to expeditiously approve Governor Mills’ request for Major Disaster Declarations for the counties in question. Handling this expeditiously is especially warranted as many of these areas have been affected by other disasters, some natural, some economic, all of which have made this a particularly difficult year for the region. The people of Maine are in great need of this federal assistance, and we thank you for your support.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n###'],\n",

Many found they were underinsured and unable to rebuild.\\n\\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency recently announced a slate of changes to some long-standing rules about assistance after a disaster.\\n\\nIt’s no secret that FEMA’s process for distributing individual help can be glacial and burdensome. And, as many homeowners have learned, their insurance often doesn’t come close to covering the cost of disaster-related repairs. The December 2023 Marshall Fire, which destroyed over 1,000 homes southeast of Boulder, Colo., brought these issues to light when homeowners were unable to quickly get the assistance they needed. Many found they were underinsured and unable to rebuild.\\n\\nFEMA hopes that beginning March 22, states, tribes and those impacted by disasters will have an easier time getting what they need. Here’s a summary of the changes:\\n\\nDisaster survivors will no longer have to apply for a loan through the Small Business Administration to receive FEMA assistance.\\n\\nFEMA can now help homeowners cover costs not covered by insurance. Previously, if an insurance payout exceeded the agency’s cap of $42,500, FEMA was unable to offer additional assistance. Going forward, homeowners can now get the difference covered by FEMA. This is especially important as homeowners are finding it increasingly difficult to pay rising premiums and often can’t afford insurance without high deductibles.\\n\\nAfter disaster strikes, people with disabilities can now rebuild their homes to make them more accessible using FEMA funds; homes with issues, such as a leaky roof, that existed before a disaster can get funding to make repairs.\\n\\nA new category of aid, “displacement assistance,” helps people who are unable to return to their homes by providing money for temporary housing while they look for a new place.\\n\\nFEMA is removing the barriers to critical needs assistance, which is an immediate $750 payment that disaster survivors can tap into after a disaster to help them acquire food, clothing or anything else they need. Previously, states and tribes had to apply for this type of assistance, and it was granted on a case-by-case basis. Now, the $750 becomes available as soon as a disaster is declared that meets FEMA’s requirements for individual assistance.\\n\\nTo learn more about programs available to states and state policy options, see NCSL’s new report, State Policy Considerations for Disaster Risk and Resilience. NCSL also just released a Resilience Planning Policy Toolkit, which aims to be a one-stop resource for policymakers looking to help their states better prepare for extreme weather and future disasters.\\n\\nKim Tyrrell is the associate director of NCSL’s Environment Program.'],\n",

       "  '18-01-2024',\n",
       "  'Assistant Professor Maria Sakovsky co-designed a portable antenna that can communicate with satellites and devices on the ground, making it easier to coordinate rescue and relief efforts in disaster-prone areas. (Image credit: Andrew Brodhead)\\n\\nWhen an earthquake, flood, or other disaster strikes a region, existing communication infrastructure such as cell phone and radio towers are often damaged or destroyed. Restoring emergency communications as quickly as possible is vital for coordinating rescue and relief efforts.\\n\\nResearchers at Stanford University and the American University of Beirut (AUB) have developed a portable antenna that could be quickly deployed in disaster-prone areas or used to set up communications in underdeveloped regions. The antenna, described recently in Nature Communications, packs down to a small size and can easily shift between two configurations to communicate either with satellites or devices on the ground without using additional power.\\n\\n“The state-of-the-art solutions typically employed in these areas are heavy, metallic dishes. They’re not easy to move around, they require a lot of power to operate, and they’re not particularly cost-effective,” said Maria Sakovsky, an assistant professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford. “Our antenna is lightweight, low-power, and can switch between two operating states. It’s able to do more with as little as possible in these areas where communications are lacking.”\\n\\nTwo functions in one antenna\\n\\nThe researchers developed the antenna with an approach typically used to design devices that are being deployed in space. Because of fuel and space limitations, technology being sent into orbit must be very lightweight and packaged as small as possible. Once the items are in orbit, they unfold into the proper shape for use. The researchers wanted their antenna to be similarly collapsible and lightweight.\\n\\nThe antenna designed by Sakovsky and her colleagues at AUB, including Joseph Costantine, Youssef Tawk, and Rosette Maria Bichara, is made of fiber composites (a material often used in satellites) and resembles a child’s finger-trap toy, with multiple strips of material crossing in spirals. Just like any helix-based antenna, conductive material running through the antenna sends out signals, but thanks to its unique structure, the researchers can adjust the pattern and power of those signals in the new antenna by pulling it into longer shapes or shorter shapes.\\n\\nGo to the web site to view the video.\\n\\nVideo by Stanford Reconfigurable & Active Structures Lab The researchers can adjust the pattern and power of signals in the new antenna by pulling it into longer shapes or shorter shapes.\\n\\n“Because we wanted the antenna to be able to collapse into a packable shape, we started with this structure that led us to a very untraditional antenna design,” Sakovsky said. “We’re using shapes that have never been used on helical antennas before, and we’ve shown that they work.”\\n\\nAt its most compact, the antenna is a hollow ring that stands just over 1 inch tall and about 5 inches across – not much larger than a bracelet – and weighs 1.4 ounces. In this shape, it’s able to reach satellites with a high-power signal sent in a particular direction. When stretched out to about a foot tall, the antenna sends a lower power signal in all directions, more like a Wi-Fi router.\\n\\nShifting between these two states is as simple as pulling or pushing on the antenna. These movements don’t even need to be particularly precise because, once the antenna is moved past a certain point, the structure snaps to the right position. The specific size and shape of the antenna design will determine which frequencies those two states communicate across.\\n\\n“The frequency you want to operate at will dictate how large the antenna needs to be, but we’ve been able to show that no matter what frequency you operate at, you can scale this design principle to achieve the same performance,” Sakovsky said.\\n\\nThe fabricated prototype was tested for deployment and structural performance at Stanford and its electromagnetic radiation characteristics at the antenna measurement facilities at AUB.\\n\\nThe bi-stable deployable quadrifilar helix antenna passively reconfigures its radiation characteristics in terms of pattern and polarization. (Image credit: Courtesy Reconfigurable & Active Structures Lab)\\n\\nApplications in orbit\\n\\nTo be deployed in the field, the antenna would need to be paired with a transceiver to send and receive signals, a ground plane to reflect radio waves, and other electronics, but the whole package would still only weigh about 2 pounds, Sakovsky said. And the antenna’s unique dual functionality means that it could replace multiple heavier antennas in areas where deployment is a challenge.\\n\\nThat includes uses in disaster-struck and underdeveloped areas, but also, potentially, in space. Sakovsky and her colleagues are considering adapting their design for satellite communications, allowing satellites to use the same antenna to talk to each other and to talk to the ground.\\n\\n“We don’t have a lot of spare operating power, volume, or mass on our spacecraft either,” Sakovsky said. “This holds a lot of potential for replacing multiple antennas on a satellite with a single one.”'],\n",

       " [\"Hochul says cannabis rollout was a 'disaster' but fixing it is unlikely\",\n",
       "  None,\n",
       "  'Gov. Kathy Hochul has made no secret of her unhappiness with New York State’s rollout of the legalization of cannabis.\\n\\nAnd that unhappiness is growing.\\n\\n“It’s a disaster,” the governor told The Buffalo News editorial board last week. “I will not defend that for one second.”\\n\\nHochul, who inherited New York’s marijuana legalization act when she became governor in August 2021, has no issue with the policy itself. “I’m glad we stopped the mass incarceration of young people for consumption,” she said. “It’s the right policy.”\\n\\nBut nearly three years after the law was passed and signed in March 2021, she said she has deep concerns about the implementation.\\n\\nIn a lengthy and detailed response to a question from The News’ editorial board, Hochul – who typically maintains an even tone when discussing policy – slapped her hand on the table when calling the rollout a “disaster,” and added, “You have to go back to the very beginning. Prior to my time (as governor), the legislation was crafted in a way that was not poised for success.”\\n\\nA law with no ‘teeth’\\n\\nNew York’s Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act legalized the use of marijuana for adults ages 21 and up, and also led to the removal or expunging of nearly 400,000 cannabis-related arrests and convictions. Although research has shown that white people use cannabis as much or more than people of color, the vast majority of arrests were of Black and brown people.\\n\\n“This legislation was important to do from an equitable perspective,” Assembly Majority Crystal Peoples-Stokes said in a conversation last September with The News’ editorial board. Peoples-Stokes, who like Hochul is a Buffalo Democrat, sponsored the legislation.\\n\\n“It didn’t start with an equity intent,” Peoples-Stokes said. “It wasn’t intended to be equitable; it was intended to provide an opportunity for a new market in America to come from below ground to above ground.”\\n\\nThe way in which the legislation structures and regulates the emergence of that new market is where Hochul has a problem. While the law quickly made the use of cannabis legal, it also made the process of being able to sell it legally in New York one that is slow and difficult.\\n\\nHochul had expected about 400 retail and grower licenses to be reviewed by last week, but the Office of Cannabis Management Cannabis Control Board had been prepared to approve just three new retail locations.\\n\\nThat has led to unlicensed sellers freely and openly peddling pot, without paying taxes to the state and with little fear of consequences.\\n\\nIn her conversation with The News, Hochul described her concerns:\\n\\nA law without “teeth.” Hochul, who lived in Buffalo until taking over for former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in August 2021, spends much of her time in New York City. Which means she spends much of her time seeing weed being sold illegally.\\n\\n“It’s not (on) every street corner,” she said of unauthorized marijuana sales in New York City. “It is every other storefront. It is insane.”\\n\\nHochul wants the State Legislature to empower local police to stop the sale of unlicensed, untaxed cannabis.\\n\\n“I think it should be treated the way tobacco is: local law enforcement can stop illegal sale of cigarettes that are not licensed and taxed,” she said, noting that she advocated for stricter laws last year but had little success. “They don’t want to have the teeth in the law to stop the illegals.”\\n\\nStructural slowdowns. Hochul pointed to what she considers to be framework issues in the law, which was passed by the Legislature and signed by Cuomo in spring 2021, as slowing the rollout. “I’m frustrated,” Hochul said, pointing to an operational structure that includes having a paid executive director of the Office of Cannabis Management, and also a paid chair of the Cannabis Control Board. “So, inherently, conflict was built in as to who’s the ultimate decider. That didn’t go well.”\\n\\nHochul also called it a “bad idea” to have the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York, which typically focuses on construction and financing, in charge of finding locations for smaller retail shops. “That was not their forte,” she said. “Bad idea. So that took a long time.”\\n\\nStarting over ‘not likely’\\n\\nThe governor also addressed a significant legal slowdown that lifted only recently: The law gave prioritized opportunity to open dispensaries to people who have been convicted of weed-related offenses, and to their close relatives. That provoked lawsuits from large medical marijuana companies and from veterans, and last summer, a judge put a halt to the issuing of any new licenses.\\n\\nThose lawsuits were settled and the injunction lifted in late 2023, opening the way for more than 400 license-holders statewide to open their shops. But during those months of court-imposed limbo, Hochul said, “We’ve got farmers who are just losing money. We’ve got these people who took out loans and are excited about their opportunities, ready to start. And meanwhile, no money is flowing back to the state. We have all this, and the illicit market is flourishing.”\\n\\nHochul acknowledged that the opportunity to make the fixes she’d like to see is limited.\\n\\n“There’s a strong part of me that would just like to go in and just start over,” she said. “But I’d have to go back to the Legislature and convince them to change the laws in every way I’ve described. It’s probably not likely to happen.”\\n\\nInstead, Hochul is going to ask the Legislature to stiffen the deterrents to selling without a license.\\n\\n“There should be strict penalties and fines, and there aren’t,” she said. “The Legislature needs to increase the penalties, and I’ve tried. I’ll try again.”']]"
